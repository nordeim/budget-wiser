// Session-174 (WP-1): THE TYPE-GATE HARDENING — the config source-pin
// battery. The rotation trigger: the repo's OWN newest artifacts (commit
// 25f1847 — skills/web-application/SKILL.md v1.0.0, the four-sibling
// family distillation, + skills/web-application/codebase-evaluation-
// report.md, the comparative audit that ranks neo-crm #1 at 8.55 while
// naming its defect register). The report's §9.2 graft list prescribes
// exactly the three moves this round lands; its findings register carries
// them (F-5 Medium · F-6 Medium · N-4 Low, all Verified). The code-wins
// rule runs in reverse this round: the code disagrees with the repo's own
// distilled doctrine — so the code is what gets fixed.
//
// The audit's finding register (each verified live against the source):
//   F-174a  next.config.ts set typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true — the
//           build was NOT a type gate; a planted type error compiled
//           GREEN into the deployable artifact (reproduced live at this
//           round's gate-proof: the SAME plant swallowed under the old
//           posture, caught under the new one). The repo's own skill
//           §2: "do NOT set ignoreBuildErrors — the build should be the
//           type gate"; the report §9.2: "From zero-balance: drop
//           ignoreBuildErrors and make the build the type gate".
//   F-174b  tsconfig.json carried noImplicitAny: false — weakened strict
//           mode (the report §9.2: "From digma: enable full TS
//           strictness"). The flip probe surfaced exactly THREE
//           implicit-any stragglers repo-wide — scripts/sweep.ts:862
//           (find = (k)) + :873 (union = (x, y)) against a bare new
//           Map() — the inline twin of the FULLY-TYPED pure seam at
//           line 607. The entire src/ tree was already clean.
//   F-174c  Two lockfiles committed (bun.lock + package-lock.json) — the
//           s61/s62 §16ba npm-world-parity rule, superseded by the new
//           skill's Appendix A lesson 14: "Two lockfiles in one repo is
//           a reproducibility bug — one package manager, one lockfile".
//           The npm-world path (install_packages.sh) installs by package
//           NAME from the registry — it never consumed the lockfile.
