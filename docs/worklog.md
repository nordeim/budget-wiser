Task: Clone neo-crm scaffold + scandihaven reference; recon target app https://neo-crm-8ab2c17c.base44.app/

Work Log:
- Cloned https://github.com/nordeim/neo-crm.git -> /home/z/my-project/neo-crm (scaffold: Next.js 16.3.6, React 19, Prisma/SQLite, Tailwind 4.3.3, radix, zustand, vitest, playwright; old ORBITAL project files present, to be replaced)
- Cloned scandihaven-ref (reference repo for stack conventions: Next 16 App Router, RSC-first, Server Actions/REST envelope, Tailwind v4 CSS-first tokens with literal hex, mobile drawer nav patterns)
- Logged into target base44 app via agent-browser (sepnetflix2023@outlook.com); captured 23 screenshots in /home/z/my-project/target-app-screenshots/ + full a11y snapshots of every page
- Pages discovered: Login, Dashboard(/), Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Calendar, Activities, Reports, Settings, user menu (Profile/Logout)
- **CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED**: on mobile viewport (390px) the target app renders NO navigation — no hamburger, no drawer; only the avatar "S" dropdown (Profile/Logout). Sidebar simply disappears. Our clone MUST implement a working mobile drawer nav (hamburger -> slide-out, focus-trap, scroll lock, close-on-route-change).
- Visual spec via VLM: blue sidebar #2563EB (~250px, white text/icons, active = white/15 bg), white topbar with gray pill search (#F3F4F6), KPI cards white rounded-xl on #F9FAFB bg, primary action blue #3B82F6, Inter font, lucide icons, green/red delta chips
- Target data model inferred: Accounts (name, industry, email, phone, website, annual revenue, employees, tier A/B/C, key account, status, owner), Contacts (name, email*, phone, company, position, source, priority), Leads (name, email, phone, company, estimated value, stage New/Qualified/Won/Lost + pipeline stages, source, next follow-up), Events (title, type Meeting/Appointment/Call/Task, status, start/end, location), Activities (Call/Email/Meeting/WhatsApp/Task/Note, due, status, related-to), Settings (editable lists: contact sources, lead stages, activity types, account tiers, industries; defaults: currency AED, stage new, tier B, follow-up 3 days, calendar Month, week starts Monday; data export/reset)
- Delegated deep-read of scandihaven docs + neo-crm skills folder to 2 Explore agents (reports received; key takeaways: Tailwind v4 @theme literal-hex tokens, @import "tw-animate-css" for radix animations, `hidden` attr overrides display utilities, mobile menu failure taxonomy, z-index flat scale, ActionResult envelope, scrypt+HMAC cookie auth pattern from old AGENTS.md)

Stage Summary:
- Recon complete. Next: write CRM prisma schema, lib seams (auth/api/db/format/csv), Tailwind v4 globals.css, UI kit, zustand store, API routes, 9 pages + login/signup/profile, charts (recharts), seed, tests, dev server, mobile-nav verification, screenshots, git push via SSH wrapper (paramiko shim needed - no ssh binary, pip blocked by PEP668 -> use --break-system-packages), then 4 docs via skills, final push.

Task ID: 2
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Build the complete NEO CRM clone in /home/z/my-project/neo-crm

Work Log:
- Replaced Prisma schema with CRM domain (User, Account, Contact, Lead, Activity, Event, SavedReport, Setting singleton)
- Lib seams: db-path (SQLite path normalization), db (singleton), auth (scrypt + HMAC cookie `neo_session`), api ({ok,data} envelope + guards), rate-limit (10/15min login), format (currency/date/calendar/relative-time), csv (toCsv/parseCsv), constants (stage/status vocabularies + chart palette), download helper
- globals.css: Tailwind v4 CSS-first tokens (literal hex @theme — no var() chains), @utility scrollbar-thin/input-base/chart-no-outline
- UI kit: button/input/card/dialog/select/dropdown/table/tabs/badge/label+checkbox/avatar/toast/misc — all Radix-based or native-ARIA
- Zustand store with hydrate() + per-entity fetch/CRUD actions (API envelope client)
- 16 API routes (auth login/signup/logout/me, users, accounts+id, contacts+id, leads+id, activities+id, events+id, dashboard, reports, settings, search, export, reset, health) — all session-gated, force-dynamic, hand-rolled validation
- App shell: fixed blue sidebar (lg+), sticky topbar with debounced global search + user menu, MobileNav drawer (THE fix: focus trap, Escape, scroll lock, close-on-route-change via adjust-during-render, inert when closed, visibility transition)
- 11 pages: login, signup, dashboard (6 KPIs, filter bar, 2 charts, 4 lists, recent deals), accounts (5 KPIs, filters panel, tier checkboxes), contacts (sort, scan-card dialog, CSV import), leads (sort, 3 charts, funnel), calendar (month grid, agenda, day click), activities (quick-log buttons, priority tabs, timeline, by-type chart), reports (5 tabs, period/owner/stage/status filters, weighted forecast), settings (picklist editors, defaults, data/danger zone), profile
- Entity dialogs use remount-via-key pattern (zero setState-in-effect — React 19 lint clean)
- Seed: demo user sepnetflix2023@outlook.com/$Abcd1234 (mirrors target app), 3 team reps, 10 accounts, 15 contacts, 24 leads across 7 stages/6 months, 20 activities, 12 events, settings
- Tests: 5 vitest suites (47 checks: db-path, auth, format, csv, rate-limit) + 4 Playwright specs (20 checks incl. 5 mobile-navigation regression tests)
- BUGS FOUND & FIXED:
  1. postcss.config.mjs MISSING from scaffold -> Tailwind v4 directives (@theme/@utility) uncompiled -> page rendered unstyled. Created config with @tailwindcss/postcss.
  2. tw-animate-css package uses `style` export condition -> Turbopack CSS import fails. Vendored dist CSS to src/app/vendor/tw-animate.css (MIT).
  3. Store hydrate() was never wired -> added to AppShell mount; /api/auth/me unwrapped user envelope.
  4. E2E SQLite stale-inode: global-setup deleted db file under a reused server -> changed to in-place idempotent reseed (never rm the file).
  5. Closed mobile drawer needed visibility:hidden for correct hidden-state semantics -> transition-[visibility] pattern.
- Verification gate: lint 0 errors/0 warnings, tsc clean, vitest 47/47, build clean (standalone), Playwright 20/20
- agent-browser verification: login flow, dashboard data (24 leads, charts render with bars/lines), all 9 pages, mobile drawer opens with all 8 nav links + navigates + closes + scroll locks + Escape, VLM visual checks passed

Stage Summary:
- Complete working clone at /home/z/my-project/neo-crm, dev server on :3000, e2e db isolated at db/e2e.db
- Next: SSH wrapper setup (paramiko shim - no ssh binary), git commit + push to git@github.com:nordeim/neo-crm.git, then docs via skills, screenshots, final push

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Git push (codebase), documentation via skills, screenshots, final push

Work Log:
- SSH push infra: paramiko installed into venv (pip --user blocked by PEP668), paramiko shim deployed at /home/z/my-project/bin/ssh (outside the repo), operator key saved to /tmp with 0600 then shredded after use
- First push: commit e16efb9 (full codebase) -> git@github.com:nordeim/neo-crm.git main via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (dry-run first, then real push with remote ref verification)
- Read all 4 doc skills (agents-md, claude-md, readme-md, project-architecture-document-md) and authored the 4 root docs per their procedures:
  - AGENTS.md (compact agent contract), CLAUDE.md (Meticulous Approach), README.md (badges/features/mermaid/quick-start), Project_Architecture_Document.md (7 ADRs, ER diagram, layer model, security rules, test distribution, key files, glossary)
- Captured 11 dev-server screenshots into docs/screenshots/ (login, 8 desktop pages, mobile dashboard + mobile nav drawer), VLM-verified styling/data
- BUG FOUND & FIXED during screenshot QA: /api/reports treated the UI "all" sentinel as a literal ownerId/stage/status value -> zeroed the default reports view. Fixed with notAll() normalization; e2e regression pinned (stable AED 542.0K assertion that survives the lead-creation test)
- Also fixed: invalid eslint key in NextConfig (removed in Next 16); test-order interaction in reports e2e (24->25 leads)
- Final gate re-run: lint 0/0, typecheck clean, vitest 47/47, build clean, Playwright 20/20
- Final push: commit 7f71cca (docs + screenshots + fixes) -> remote verified @ 7f71cca == local HEAD
- Operator key shredded; dev server still running on :3000 (healthy, session works, all APIs 200)

Stage Summary:
- Remote git@github.com:nordeim/neo-crm.git main @ 7f71cca with: complete clone codebase, 4 architecture docs, 11 screenshots
- Deliverable state: dev server on :3000, demo login sepnetflix2023@outlook.com / $Abcd1234, 67 automated checks green

Task: Session 2 — remediation, parity iteration, SKILL distillation, push

Work Log:
- git pull refreshed workspace to 9eb86eb (session_1.md, prompt-to-review.md, repo worklog)
- Full doc + codebase review; audit produced remediation plan (docs/plans/2026-09-29-session2-remediation.md) with R-1..R-7, validated against codebase before execution
- TDD execution: 9 new failing tests first (urlForRoot/parseEnvFile/effectiveDatabaseUrl/runtimeDatabaseUrl), then the fix
- Root cause chase for the db-location bug: 21 controlled experiments isolated bun's .env-relative absolutization of file: URLs (process env = schema-relative; .env-loaded = .env-dir-relative; bun absolutizes; prisma/.env doesn't help; bun --env-file doesn't chain; bunshell doesn't source)
- Fix stack: db-path seam (182 lines) + db.ts/seed.ts rewiring + scripts/prisma-env.ts wrapper for db:push; live fd verification passed
- Dependency hygiene: removed tailwindcss-animate + z-ai-web-dev-sdk everywhere
- Parity iteration via VLM comparison loop: sparklines, KPI casing, 3-button header, owner filter, More... link — HIGH parity verdicts on dashboard + accounts
- 11 screenshots refreshed; 4 root docs realigned; neo-crm_SKILL.md distilled (1,019 lines, verified claims)
- Final gate: lint 0/0, tsc clean, 58/58 unit, build clean, 20/20 e2e

Stage Summary:
- Next: git commit (main only) + push via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py with paramiko shim

Task: Session 3 — parity hardening vs fresh live-site audit, TDD remediation, docs, push

Work Log:
- git pull refreshed workspace to c4a48c1 (docs/session_2.md + docs/worklog.md from the operator)
- Reviewed AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, PAD, neo-crm_SKILL.md, session_2.md, session-2 remediation plan; validated understanding against the codebase (structure, db handles at <repo>/db/custom.db, gate green at 58/58 + 20/20)
- Fresh login audit of https://neo-crm-8ab2c17c.base44.app/: captured all 9 pages at 1512x945 + mobile 390x844; KEY FINDING: the reference's demo data has been RESET TO ZERO (all KPIs 0, empty tables) — it was also zero at session-1 capture time — so parity targets STRUCTURE, not data
- VLM + a11y + crop-zoom audit produced the session-3 remediation plan (docs/plans/2026-09-29-session3-parity-remediation.md, P-1..P-17), validated against the codebase before execution
- TDD Phase A: failing tests first (currency $ contract, avatar luminance ink, sunday-anchored grid) then implementations
- Executed P-1..P-16: topbar identity (Hi, sepnetflix2023 + grey S avatar, no bell dot, text-only Profile/Logout dropdown, white bordered search), sidebar (User/CircleUserRound icons, ring-only brand, Settings after divider), $-attached currency display everywhere, KpiCard plain-text deltas + line/area/bar sparkline variants, IconStatCard/CircleStatCard/TrendStatCard family, count-axis pipeline chart + $ legends, area-filled revenue chart, Title-Case table headers + chevron sorters, contacts solid-icon cards + ScanLine + funnel Filters, leads tinted-icon cards + New/Qualified/Won/Lost chart, calendar search + trend cards + Sunday grid + Type/Date filters, activities 6-card row + green WhatsApp + segmented tabs + by-type recharts + More Filters/Filter, reports Saved Reports (0) + white filter card + pill tabs + circle KPI cards, settings instant-save + segmented tabs, profile rebuilt to reference layout + new PATCH /api/users
- Mid-execution fixes: devIndicators false (clean captures), contacts default sort lastActivity desc, profile keyed-remount (caught by first e2e run), seed role "user"
- Final gate: lint 0/0, tsc clean, 65/65 unit (6 suites), build clean, 21/21 e2e (incl. 5-check mobile-nav regression + new profile/auth pins)
- Live verification at both widths; 12 screenshots refreshed in docs/screenshots/; docs realigned (AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PAD/SKILL); plan addendum written

Stage Summary:
- Next: git commit (main only) + push via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py with paramiko shim

Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Session 5 — interactive-layer parity, TDD remediation, docs, push

Work Log:
- git pull refreshed workspace to b9f388f (docs/session_5.md — the session-4 transcript, saved by the operator)
- Reviewed all root docs + session_4.md, the session-4 plan and both worklogs; baseline validated against the codebase (lint 0/0, tsc clean, 68/68 unit, dev server healthy, .env/db/test configs all correct)
- Fresh live-site audit (login + DOM extraction at 1512×945 + 390×844): reference data still zeroed; mobile nav defect re-confirmed (zero nav elements at 390px); our drawer re-verified end-to-end (open → 8 links → focus into panel → Escape → scroll lock)
- Session-5 audit went one layer deeper than session 4: opened every create dialog, expanded every listbox, extracted table cell classes — produced S5-1…S5-16 (table density/headers/wrappers/empty states, compact Recent Deals, responsive column hiding, activities subtext deltas, reports/leads card anatomies, card typography, all five dialogs' field sets + option vocabularies, dashboard filter vocabularies, currency variants, Avg-card suffix)
- Wrote + validated docs/plans/2026-09-29-session5-parity-remediation.md against the codebase before execution
- TDD Phase A red-first: 7 new failing checks (vocabularies + uppercase-K formatter variants), then green after constants + formatCompactCurrency options; 75/75 unit
- Phases B–J: Table retuned to stock density (th px-2, td p-2); per-page wrappers/headers/empty rows; compact Recent Deals; leads responsive hiding (Phone md, Company lg, Source xl); activities subtext deltas + w-20 bars; reports CircleStatCard rebuilt (square chip, inline count+amount, $542.0K/$196K); leads compact cards + full $687,000 currency; card primitives (p-6, text-base sm:text-lg titles); all five create dialogs mirrored to the reference (incl. unqualified stage, 4 lead sources, 5 emoji contact sources, 6 event types, Related To fields on event + activity); schema += Event.relatedType + Activity.relatedType/relatedName (db push); seed sources remapped with values/stages unchanged; isDroppedStage seam adopted
- Full gate: lint 0/0 · tsc clean · 75/75 unit · build clean · 21/21 e2e (mobile-nav 5/5 intact)
- Every S5-item DOM-re-verified on the running clone at 1512×945 + 390/768/1024/1280; 12 screenshots refreshed; AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PAD realigned; neo-crm_SKILL.md v1.2.0 (session-5 entry + "audit the interactive layer" lesson); plan addendum written

Stage Summary:
- Next: Conventional Commit on main + push via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (paramiko shim, key outside repo, shredded after)

Task ID: 26 (repo)
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Session 26 — the Settings Data-tab + import/export contract layer (the s44 "Next" pointers): the three CardDescriptions, the ml-0 sm:ml-2 button margins, the native-dialog-gated reset flow, the static CSV templates, the raw-dump entity exports, the quoted page-level exports incl. the stored Account health, and the rebuilt Import Contacts dialog

Work Log:
- Workspace rebuilt from scratch (bun install, .env from .env.example with DATABASE_URL="file:../db/custom.db", db/ at the repo root via db:push + db:seed); baseline gate green (lint 0/0 · tsc · 475/475 unit)
- Standing layers re-verified FIRST with NO drift: reference mobile nav still absent at 390 (22nd session; the sidebar links exist in the DOM but every one fails getClientRects), our drawer 7/7 + zero 390px overflow on 11 routes, Tailwind v4 hazards zero, demo data zero (22nd), typography EXACTLY equal (466.8/522.4), tabs ARIA identical, the s25 layers pinned green
- NEW audit layer via the session's decisive method — byte-extraction of the reference's own minified bundle (fetch every /assets/ + /static/ script + indexOf walks), which unlocked the three "data-gated — 22 sessions" surfaces; six findings (S26-P1..P6), all live + bundle verified; the import-success probe was self-undoing (the danger-zone reset wiped the created contact, the zero-data state verified restored)
- TDD Phase A: 50 red checks across six suites (RED 46/4 confirmed before implementation; the pin shapes refined mid-red — the region-anchor + quoted-literal lessons)
- Phase B: the page-layout pins, the settings Data tab rewrite (descriptions + buttonClsAlt + Trash2 + the reference's exact confirm/alert handler), src/lib/csv-templates.ts + src/lib/entity-export.ts, the Account health field (schema + types + the seeded three-state vocabulary), the contacts export + the rebuilt import dialog, the accounts export + the header/toolbar split, /api/export retired to type=leads + type=report
- Phase C: lint 0/0 · tsc · 525/525 unit (+50) · build · 87/87 e2e (+8; two flakes resolved — the s15 Event-dialog box + the accounts-export hydrate race) + LIVE re-verification on the dev server (descriptions, template artifacts, raw dumps, the reset round-trip, the quoted page CSVs, the import dialog attribute-by-attribute, the wipe→reseed cycle)
- Phase D: 26 screenshots (the 24 established + shots 25/26), .env/.env.example re-verified, docs realigned (README 612, AGENTS, CLAUDE, PAD 37/525+87, SKILL v1.23.0 §16r, session_45.md, the plan addendum, both worklogs)

Stage Summary:
- PUSHED: session-26 commit on main -> git@github.com:nordeim/neo-crm.git via the SSH wrapper; all suites green (525 unit / 87 e2e); docs at SKILL v1.23.0; the reference's import path (its base44 AI-extraction platform dependency) deliberately replaced by the local CSV parse — documented divergence

Task ID: 47 (repo)
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Session 47 — the export-rewire + vocabulary + feedback layer (the F-47 audit quartet): the dashboard's five dead export affordances rewired to the client-side entity-export family, the insights icon vocabulary, the leads inline-edit debounced feedback, the topbar import hygiene

Work Log:
- Fresh clone (sandbox reset); baseline gate green (lint 0/0 · tsc · 1119/1119); drift sweep 43rd clean (md5 identical, 18th stable); reference mobile-nav defect stands, our drawer verified all directions, zero 390px overflow ×9 routes, no Tailwind v4 bug
- Dual audits (47-a: the seven s46 families GENUINE, pins mechanically non-vacuous in a pre-fix worktree, zero regressions; 47-b: zero graduations, 13 ledger items + 4 pointers re-confirmed) + manual validation of every headline claim at file:line (incl. the reference bundle decode: its dashboard trio carries NO onClick and its activity types are Capitalized — both parity facts that shaped the fixes)
- RED: 11 failing pins + 1 happy-path regression guard across 4 new suites (dashboard-export 6, insights-vocabulary 2, leads-inline-feedback 3, topbar-import-hygiene 1); all 1119 pre-existing green through RED
- GREEN: the five dashboard affordances → the pages' own client-side builders verbatim (leads_/contacts_/accounts_/activity_ ISO files, zero /api/export references, one new download e2e); the six insights comparisons lowercased (tints + icon map verbatim); the three leads arrows chained into one 500 ms debounced failure toast + unmount cleanup; the topbar dead Dropdown import block removed
- Gate: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 1131/1131 unit (67 suites) · build clean · 109/109 e2e fresh CI=1 (the new dashboard-export e2e #77); LIVE: four menu downloads + the one-click primary with the URL staying /, the green Phone icon on the seeded call (was all-purple), the offline burst → exactly ONE toast, zero residue 15/24/10/23/12
- Screenshots 02/11/12 + 55-insights-activity-icons NEW (02+55 VLM-verified); docs realigned (README 1240, AGENTS 1131/109, CLAUDE 1131, PAD s47 row/67 suites, SKILL v1.44.0 §16am, session_87.md, the plan's execution record, both worklogs)

Stage Summary:
- SHIPPED: session-47 commit on main via the SSH wrapper (key shredded after) — the dashboard exports alive again after 18 dead sessions, the insights icons matched to our vocabulary, the leads inline edits now feedback-complete, the e2e coverage gap closed

Task ID: 48
Agent: main (session-48)
Task: The session-48 remediation — the two operator decisions (CSV posture b + the source-vocabulary documented-parity posture) + N-48b/N-48g, RED-first, gated, LIVE-verified, shipped

Work Log:
- Baseline verified (042bfe0, lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 1131/1131), the 44th drift sweep clean (19th stable bundle), the dual audits clean (four s47 families genuine, zero graduations), the decision evidence extracted from the bundle (ContactSource consumed only by the settings page; the reference's reports export a client-side blob).
- The decisions landed: (1) posture (b) — guardFormulaPrefix shared by csv.ts escapeCell + entity-export.ts qq (= + @ tab CR, '-excluded, templates/import untouched); (2) documented parity — the src-dead CONTACT_SOURCES + its contradictory comment removed, no enum-membership, settings defaults verbatim, the record in-file at four sites. Plus the insights badge display-case (ACTIVITY_TYPE_META labels) and the reports export fetch→blob flow (downloadFile retired, the BOM preserved via ignoreBOM).
- Gate: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 1150/1150 (71 suites, +19) · build clean · 110/110 e2e (+1, the coverage-gap closer). LIVE-verified both directions (the guard probes, the badges, the reports blob + offline toast, the drawer + 390px sweep + the Tailwind v4 contract), zero probe residue. Screenshots 02/11/12 + 56/57 NEW (VLM-verified). Docs at SKILL v1.45.0 + docs/session_89.md. Commit on main + the wrapper push (key shredded).

Stage Summary:
- Session 48 SHIPPED: the seven-session deferral closed evidence-first — every export guarded, the vocabulary posture documented with the reference's own bundle as evidence, the last navigation seam retired.

Task ID: 57 (repo)
Agent: main (Super Z, session-57)
Task: The session-57 remediation — the dead-surface narrowing (the N-57c dead usersTotal prop + the N-57b dead export keyword) + the comment-accuracy carriers, RED-first, gated, LIVE-verified

Work Log:
- Fresh clone (sandbox reset); environment rebuilt (bun install + .env + db:push/db:seed); baseline gate green (lint 0/0 · tsc · 1191/1191); census MATCH through the seam
- Drift sweep 53rd clean (28th consecutive stable bundle, md5 exact); reference census: demo data zero, mobile-nav defect stands at TRUE 390px; scandihaven stack patterns re-reviewed — already baked in
- Dual audits (57-a: the eight s56 checklist items GENUINE, worktree arithmetic replayed 7|49 pre-fix, two comment-accuracy corrections found; 57-b: zero graduations 13/13 [14th consecutive], both operator anchors standing, fresh-eyes sweep → the N-57 family) + manual validation of every claim at file:line
- The operator decisions: CSV posture (b) STANDS (15th re-affirmation); source-vocabulary parity EXTENDS to the N-57 family (app-owned dead surfaces narrow; the store users slice keeps its live write path; the stock mirror untouched)
- RED: the dead-code-hygiene session-57 describe (2 RED + 1 guard) — exactly 2 failures; full suite 2 failed / 1192 passed (1194 total)
- GREEN: the five comment corrections (nav-config mt-auto truth; Avatar attribution ×3 carriers + the :381→:384 refresh; seven→ten ×2) + the dead-surface narrowing (profile-page prop/type/destructure; uploads.ts export keyword)
- Non-vacuousness: pre-fix 5b86880 worktree → 2 failed | 25 passed (exactly the RED set); worktree cleaned
- Gate: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 1194/1194 unit (75 suites, +3) · build clean · 112/112 e2e fresh CI=1 (all 7 mobile-nav green). LIVE: Profile page full contract + save round-trip + /api/users 200; drawer both directions at TRUE 390px; zero 390px overflow ×10 routes; NO Tailwind v4 bug (blur 4px + the pinned shadow); zero probe residue (db:census MATCH)
- Screenshots 02/11/12 re-captured + 66-profile-page NEW (all VLM-verified); docs realigned (README badge 1306, AGENTS, CLAUDE, PAD, SKILL v1.54.0 §16aw via the assert-first script, session_107.md, the plan's execution record, both worklogs); .env/.env.example re-verified (no surface change)

Stage Summary:
- Session 57 SHIPPED: the orphaned-import class's PROP and EXPORT variants swept (dead since s10 for the prop), the record-comment accuracy raised, 13/13 ledger zero graduations for the 14th consecutive session, both operator decisions standing, the reference bundle stable for the 28th consecutive session

Task ID: 152
Agent: main (session-152)
Task: The session-152 rotation — the walk41 interior census promoted into the STANDING SIXTH GATE (the L-151c2 dead-zone cure): scripts/interior-census.ts + the census:interior gate in gate:full + the 22-pin suite, the maiden all-zero census, the F-151c1 mutation-proof, the docs ladder, the ship

Work Log:
- git pull to 0d98454 (the s151 ship + the owner's session_322 transcript); the environment verified standing (.env root contract, census MATCH, dev server); the baseline gate GREEN at the EXACT s151-ship match (lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 118/2177 · build · e2e 153/153 first run)
- The audit battery: probe:ref #126 STABLE at the s147-s151 fingerprint (a rotation round); the drawer battery GREEN inside e2e; the five drift gates CLEAN x5 (the fullpage at the exact s151-ship values 0.093/0.316 at equal heights); sitemap 11 + robots; the tree clean; zero dep changes
- walk42 PASS 1 — the maiden census: the tool's first run IS the walk; five decoder rounds against the live reference peeled the 79+ unexplained face-by-face: the lucide glyph-interior EXCLUSION at the collector (the census is a layout-tree instrument; three coincidentally-aligned icon paths were sustaining FALSE resyncs) · the recharts DOM face (cls + chart-box containment) · the tag-swap PAIRING (the s76 calendar cells across the tag difference; the -1px subpixel running-offset decode forced the window form) · the wrapper-twin face (an extra byte-equal to a PAIRED box) · the composition-split face (the token-superset containment) · the s95 poke-out with the 358px FLOOR discriminator · the s16 stock-table container · the byte-equal-cls preference · the piecewise direct re-anchor + the sustain-checked pure runs · the settings card SEGMENTATION (the -162 cross-card backward resync decoded and made structurally impossible) — THE MAIDEN VERDICT: ALL 9 PAGES AT ZERO UNEXPLAINED (mainH byte-equal on the 8; settings +86 the documented LIVE-intraday DATA genus, mainH skipped, the L-150c2 doctrine)
- walk42 PASS 2 — the mutation-proof: the F-151c1 ghost replanted in the Lead Sources header via string surgery -> RED (mainH +8 — the exact F-151c1 arithmetic — + 39 unexplained) -> the string-surgery revert (never git checkout) -> GREEN (mainH 0, 0 unexplained); the 143-session defect class now fails the one-command gate
- THE PINS: tests/interior-census-tool.test.ts NEW +22 (RED at birth 13 -> GREEN; the pure decoder seams + the genera whitelist + the never-zeroed finally + the --pages fail-fast + the settings segmentation + the mutation-proof doctrine); the gate-script composite flipped to the SIX-gate chain; login/waitOnUrl/parsePagesArg exported from sweep.ts (additive, zero behavior)
- The count ladder: UNIT 2177 -> 2199 · SUITES 118 -> 119 · badge 2330 -> 2352; the 12 RED lockstep sites flipped atomically (README x4 + the list tail · AGENTS x2 · PAD x5 · SKILL x2); the CLAUDE-carrier pins x4; the SKILL v1.148.0 -> v1.149.0 + the s152 head (the s151 layer demoted) + the Appendix B + the wall-clock
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-152 section · the PAD session-152 row · session_323.md · the plan execution record · this worklog
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 119/2199 · build · e2e 153/153 · the SIX drift gates CLEAN x6 (the census gate's maiden --fail-on-drift pass at all-zero) · census MATCH; the captures 349-352 (the dashboard + settings phone pairs at the matched zero-data state) + the VLM battery 2/2 (the dashboard pair: the identical card stack, the fix zone title-only both; the settings pair: the row template identical, the diffs the LIVE-DATA genus)

Stage Summary:
- SHIPPED: the session-152 two-commit pattern pushed to main via the SSH wrapper — the dead zone (below-every-fold, invisible to all five pixel gates by construction) closed STRUCTURALLY: the interior census is a standing one-command gate, byte-parity zero margin, every delta attributed to a named genus or RED; the lessons L-152c1 (the structural closure) · L-152c2 (geometry gates carry no margin) · L-152c3 (the census is a layout-tree instrument — the glyph interiors excluded) · L-152c4 (the alignment unit follows the data topology)

Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-163 AUTH RETROFIT + ZOD LAYER — port digma's auth mechanics onto neo-crm (TDD), evaluate + adopt Zod, align all docs, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- Both repos refreshed (git pull); the digma auth seams re-read file-by-file (auth/password/rate-limit/validation + the 8 auth routes + the reset spec); the neo-crm gaps censused into the G1-G7 register (no revocation, no reset flow, the timing oracle, first-hop XFF trust, the seed's duplicated scrypt, console-only OTP)
- The Zod feasibility evaluation: digma is Zod-FREE (hand-rolled clamps); zero-balance is the family's actual Zod reference (^4.6.5) — verdict FEASIBLE + RECOMMENDED incrementally; the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-22-session163-auth-retrofit-zod.md
- TDD RED (31 failing): password-seam + schemas + parse-body + auth-reset + auth versioning + rate-limit depth batteries
- GREEN: src/lib/password.ts (the pure seam) · the v-dimension in auth.ts · the forgot/reset routes (atomic single-use + eviction) · the timing equalizer · the last-hop/NEO_PROXY_HOPS clientKey · zod ^4.6.7 (schemas.ts + parseBody) · the /reset-password page + the login-card wiring + the ADR-014 deliveries
- The collateral re-anchors: S38-P1/S39-P4/S67-P2/N-62a/N-63i/N-66e + the space-y census 20/114 -> 21/117 + the login-family e2e carrier
- The count ladder: UNIT 2271 -> 2347 · SUITES 120 -> 124 · E2E 153 -> 161 · badge 2424 -> 2508 · routes 27 -> 29/39 -> 41 — every live-tense site + pin carrier re-anchored in lockstep
- The docs: .env.example (+3 vars) · AGENTS (auth bullet + Session-163) · CLAUDE ×6 · PAD (ADR-003 + the inventory row) · SKILL v1.160.0 (the s163 head + 7.4 + deps + Appendix B) · session_347.md

Stage Summary:
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 124/2347 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 (the reset round-trip + the behavioral eviction green on the first run)
- SHIPPED: the retrofit + the Zod layer + the aligned docs, committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-164 post-163 audit round — THE TEST-ISOLATION CURE + THE RESET-TOKEN HASH + THE AMORTIZED SWEEP — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace refreshed to 53089dd (git pull + bunx prisma generate — the pull's schema postdates the local generated client); the baseline gate: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · unit RED 2346/2347 · build 29 routes · e2e RED 160/161 (one load flake) · probe:ref #137 STABLE · census MATCH
- The audit (the web-app-foundation skill §12/§14 as the checklist): F-164a the ambient-env test-isolation defect (@prisma/client's .env auto-load flips secret() off the DEV fallback the s163 hand-signed battery hard-codes — bisected live to the @/lib/db import; the acceptance test fails + three rejection siblings pass VACUOUSLY) · F-164b the settings Defaults starved-read (boundingBox with no auto-wait under load) · F-164c the reset token stored PLAINTEXT (the skill §12 hashed-at-rest gap; the verification code already hashed — internally inconsistent) · F-164d the deferred S76-G sweep · F-164e bun audit absent from the discipline (9 advisories, all dev-toolchain transitive)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-22-session164-test-isolation-reset-hash-sweep.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD
- WP-1: the env-pinned battery (beforeAll plants the ambient condition, beforeEach deletes, afterAll restores) + the two regression pins (the env-pinning invariant + the foreign-key honesty mirror) — mutation-proven: the pin disabled -> exactly 3 RED
- WP-2: hashResetToken (SHA-256 hex, the fast-hash-for-256-bit-entropy doctrine) at the pure seam; the forgot route stores the hash; both reset-route lookups key on it; the delivery URL keeps the raw token; the seed clears the reset funnel (tokenVersion untouched); the schema comment re-anchored
- WP-3: the settings Defaults e2e visibility pre-waits (E2E held 161)
- WP-4: the digma S76-G port — the module watermark gates sweepRateLimits (O(1) pre-crossing no-ops returning the swept count; lazy per-key reset unchanged); the computeWatermark pure seam + 6 pins; three in-flight calibration fixes (the min-seed inversion, the real-time-now band arithmetic, the nested-paren regex)
- WP-5: the bun audit triage in the AGENTS pre-ship discipline + the PAD known-issues ledger (no mid-rotation dep bumps — the pixel-baseline doctrine)
- The count ladder: UNIT 2347 -> 2362 (+15) · SUITES 124 held · E2E 161 held · badge 2508 -> 2523 · schema 257 -> 262 · seed 516 -> 540 (count-ladder-164.py + skill-head-164.py, assert-first, idempotent; the docs-counts comment ladder + the layer-axis pins -> the s164 head; the dialog-geometry 2347-form negatives)
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-164 section + the audit line · the PAD session-164 row + the ledger row + the line-census rows · the SKILL v1.161.0 + the s164 head + §7.4's hashed-at-rest/amortized-sweep facts · session_349.md · the plan · this record

Stage Summary:
- The captures 393-396 (the reset-password landing pair + the settings Defaults pair at phone + desktop — the round's subject surfaces; ours-only, the reference's reset flow is demo theater)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 124/2362 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · probe:ref #137 STABLE · the six drift gates CLEAN x6 · census MATCH
- The lessons: L-164c1 pin the env or the test is environment-dependent (a hard-coded fallback constant inherits every ambient env leak of its import graph) · L-164c2 the vacuous green is worse than the red · L-164c3 the distilled skill outranks its source repos (digma's plaintext parity was not the bar)
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Task: The session-165 post-164 audit round — THE BOUNDED-READER PORT + THE CONTENT-TYPE CSRF GATE + THE E2E-CENSUS DOCTRINE — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace refreshed to 021fb74 (git pull; prisma generate re-run out of caution); the baseline gate GREEN at the exact s164 ship state (lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 124/2362 · build · e2e 161/161) — the test-isolation cure holding in the ambient workspace; probe:ref #138 STABLE; census MATCH
- The audit (the web-app-foundation §7.2 checklist + digma as the port donor): F-165a the content-type CSRF gate absent at every JSON parse site (the login-CSRF class — SameSite=Lax gates cookie SENDING on cross-site POSTs, never cookie SETTING; first-party census lead-verified: every JSON consumer already sends application/json) · F-165b the chunked-body bypass (isBodyTooLarge checked only the DECLARED Content-Length) · F-165c the mobile-nav e2e-count miscount (MOBILE_NAV_E2E = 11 for a 10-test spec since s147 — landing.spec gained that round's +1 while the constant got the bump, git-verified) · F-165d the Appendix B e2e rows drifted (landing 12/14 · crm 111/112 · the s163 reset-password spec absent) · F-165e/f/g the PAD route-census carriers + the SKILL §3.3/§11/§14 stale spots + ADR-014 never written
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-22-session165-bounded-reader-csrf-gate-e2e-census.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD (RED 20 → GREEN)
- WP-1: readBoundedJson in src/lib/api.ts (the digma S148-A/S75-B construction — the content-type gate + the declared fast path + the stream counter + the null-on-unparseable tail); parseBody composes it; the 13 sessioned CRUD sites swapped via crud-seam-swap-165.py (assert-first, every 400 message preserved verbatim incl. the users/reset divergent siblings; the F-69a3 gate-before-DB ordering carried); the e2e CSRF probe joined the auth 4xx quartet on its own XFF bucket (E2E held 161)
- WP-2: the mobile-nav constant 11 → 10 + the seven doc carriers + the LIVE-CENSUS pin (the count read FROM the spec file); the Appendix B e2e rows re-censused + the NEW reset-password row + the sum guard + the doctrine note narrowed; THE VACUOUS-PIN CATCH (the RegExp-template pipe escape collapsed to alternation — the pin matched everything; caught live, replaced with toContain, mutation-proven)
- WP-3: PAD's route census → the LIVE 29/41 (read from the tree by the pin) · the HEAD line's 10-spec enumeration · SKILL §3.3's six-knob table · §11's live gate-block counts · §14's Zod reality · ADR-014 formalized in PAD §1.3 + both indexes
- WP-4: the count ladder 2362 → 2382 (+20) · SUITES 124 → 125 · badge 2523 → 2543 (count-ladder-165.py, assert-first, idempotent; the docs-counts comment ladder + the dialog-geometry CLAUDE carriers + the 2362-form negatives + the 11-check-form negatives + the FIRST-layer pin → the s165 head)
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-165 section · the PAD session-165 row · the SKILL v1.162.0 + the s165 head layer + §7.4's bounded-reader facts · session_351.md · the plan's execution record · this entry

Stage Summary:
- The captures 397-400 (the login card + the reset-password landing at phone + desktop — the auth-family surfaces the bounded reader hardens)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 125/2382 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · probe:ref #138 STABLE · the six drift gates CLEAN ×6 · census MATCH
- The lessons: L-165c1 the live-census doctrine (a pin that checks doc-consistency with a constant never checks the constant against its census) · L-165c2 the RegExp-from-template escaping trap (mutation-prove regex pins at birth) · L-165c3 the e2e rows are only 10 — pin them live

Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-168 post-167 audit round — THE AGENTS-DOCTRINE CLOSURE + THE INVENTORY LIVE-CENSUS — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- (Tail-gap note: the s166/s167 rounds recorded their work in docs/session_353.md–session_356.md + their plan files but never appended worklog entries — this entry resumes the sequence at 168.)
- The workspace re-cloned at d57ef8e (the s167 ship + its session-log commit); the sandbox root's stale .env residue removed + the ambient DATABASE_URL scrubbed on every DB-touching command (the documented class); .env recreated with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET; db:push + db:seed census MATCH; the Playwright chromium installed (the standing fresh-sandbox intake)
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s167 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 128/2480 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 (clean run after the intake) · probe:ref #140 STABLE · the SIX drift gates CLEAN ×6 (the fullpage at the exact standing values; the census byte-parity zero unexplained) · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS live at 390×844 (scripts/drawer-battery-168.ts) · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap/robots/manifest source-verified · bun audit's 9-advisory posture unchanged
- The audit (the web-app-foundation §12/§14 lenses + the mega-doc digests): TEN findings all reproduced live — F-168a/b AGENTS.md's own two live-tense validation-doctrine sites (the "keeps the asString guards" incremental-path clause + the "No schema library — zod was deliberately pruned" conventions bullet — the s165/s166/s167 rounds flipped the doctrine everywhere EXCEPT the file every agent reads first) · F-168c PAD §11's Lines column SEVEN stale rows (api/constants/rate-limit/mobile-nav/app-shell/globals.css/(app)-layout — the s109 line-census family never covered these seven) · F-168d/e/f/g/h SKILL's inventory layer (the layer map 11/27 · the components 25/19 · the page enumeration · "8 models" · the Bug #1 "7-check" · the §19 primary-foreground #ffffff) · F-168i README's "nine-route" sitemap claims ×2 · F-168j the worklog tail gap
- The scandihaven z.input/z.infer colocation candidate evaluated live and closed (already embodied: parseBody returns z.output<S>; zero hand-written body interfaces)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-22-session168-agents-doctrine-inventory-live-census.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD
- WP-1: tests/inventory-census.test.ts (the 129th suite, +40) — the PAD §11 Lines-column live-census (ALL 27 rows + the row-surface census pin) + the SKILL inventory live-census (models/pages/routes/components/sitemap/mobile-nav checks + the §19 color hex, all read live) + the AGENTS doctrine pins (AGENTS.md joins the docs pin family for the first time) + the README eleven-route pins; mutation-proven at birth (the planted csv.ts line → exactly +1 RED → reverted → GREEN); three live-caught calibration fixes (the pages census 23→15 via the ROUTE-entry definition; the routes census 32→29 via the src/app/api scope; the README article form)
- WP-2: the sixteen stale sites flipped (the AGENTS clauses rewrapped for contiguous pin anchors)
- WP-3: the count ladder 2480 → 2520 (+40) · SUITES 128 → 129 · E2E 161 held · badge 2641 → 2681 (count-ladder-168.py, 28 site-group flips + the head surgery; ONE live-caught tooling defect — the insertion pairs lacked idempotency guards, a re-run double-applied → repaired + the guards moved first, the re-run verified as a 0-flip no-op) + the SKILL v1.165.0 frontmatter + H1 lockstep + the s168 head layer
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-168 section · the PAD session-168 inventory row · session_357.md · the plan's execution record · this entry

Stage Summary:
- The captures 409-412 (the landing + about pages — the s142 marketing surfaces the SKILL enumeration forgot — at phone + desktop) + the VLM battery
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 129/2520 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · db census MATCH
- The lessons: L-168c1 the rotation's blind spot is the doc it never audits (AGENTS.md joins the pin family) · L-168c2 a census definition must match the claim's semantics, not its string shape · L-168c3 an insertion is not a flip (the ladder's insertion pairs need their own idempotency guards)

Task: The session-169 post-168 audit round — THE CLAUDE-DOCTRINE CLOSURE + THE STACK-FACTS LIVE-CENSUS + THE PRODUCTION SECRET GATE — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace refreshed to a7ea4c3 (git pull — the s168 ship 1525be5 + its session-log commit); the ambient DATABASE_URL scrubbed on every DB-touching command (the documented sandbox class); the census MATCH
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s168 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 129/2520 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · probe:ref STABLE (the s168 fingerprint) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap/robots/manifest source-verified · census MATCH
- The scandihaven reference round: five port candidates evaluated — the version lockstep pin ADOPTED (the drift it kills was live here), the boot fail-fast adopted in the server-seam form (the production secret gate), three deferred (error boundaries · axe gates · fast-check — each its own rotation / the no-mid-rotation-bump posture), four rejected after evaluation
- The audit (the web-app-foundation §12/§14/§15 lenses + the parallel mega-doc digests + live verification of every claim): TWENTY-TWO findings — the headline pair F-169a CLAUDE.md the LAST un-flipped doctrine doc (zero zod mentions) + F-169p the production AUTH_SECRET warn-once fallback (forgeable sessions; the skill §6.2 posture; .env.example's false hard-error contrast) · the version-carrier family (README/PAD/SKILL still at 16.3.6/1.63 — the s163-era bump 04e367c updated no doc) · F-9 the pin-entrenched DEPLOYMENT literal ("the 27 API route handlers" + the docs-counts pin asserting it) · the PAD doctrine family (the phantom asOneOf · auth(6) · ~129 lines · the s76/s77 inversion · the s127-s130 gap) · the SKILL mirror family (§4.1's five stale tokens + the false "(complete)" label · §19's primaries · §20's 3-vars · Appendix B's ~15s) · the README vintage family (the pre-s142 tree + Quick Start + FOUR gates + the space-y 110/18) · the CLAUDE facts family (models 8 · env 3 · the stale enumerations) · the AGENTS stragglers (nine-URL · the 8-wrappers clause · the 596/38 era · the 242 color-mix)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session169-claude-doctrine-stack-facts-secret-gate.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD (RED 35 + 2 code-face pins → GREEN)
- WP-1: tests/facts-census.test.ts (the 130th suite, +36) — the version carriers read LIVE from node_modules + CLAUDE.md joins the docs pin family + the DEPLOYMENT/pin double re-anchor + the SKILL color mirror live-read + PAD's doctrine/tree/structure pins + the README tree/Quick-Start/gates pins + the AGENTS stragglers + the production-secret doc posture; mutation-proven at birth; FOUR wrap-normalization calibration catches (the s167 line-wrap lesson applied at birth)
- WP-2: the production secret gate — secret() THROWS in production on a missing/short AUTH_SECRET (the web-app-foundation §6.2 posture); dev/test keep the DEV fallback; .env.example + the README/PAD env-table cells flipped to the true posture; the auth battery's env-pinned production-gate pins (+3)
- WP-3: the ~24 stale sites flipped (CLAUDE doctrine/models/env/enumerations · README badge/tree/versions/Quick-Start/gates/space-y · PAD versions/doctrine/tree/auth(8)/~184/the s76-s77 swap + the s127-130 footnote · SKILL versions/§4.1/§19/§20/Appendix B · AGENTS eleven-URL/13-page/era markers/color-mix · DEPLOYMENT 29-route form + the docs-counts pin's live-read re-anchor)
- WP-4: the count ladder 2520 → 2559 (+39) · SUITES 129 → 130 · E2E 161 held · badge 2681 → 2720 (count-ladder-169.py, assert-first, idempotent [ONE live-caught tooling defect — the head-surgery skip-check split on the wrong --- boundary, double-applied on re-run; repaired + the guard rebuilt on the verified-single form; the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op], unique-anchor) + the SKILL v1.166.0 frontmatter + H1 lockstep + the s169 head layer
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-169 section · the PAD session-169 inventory row · session_359.md · the plan + its execution record · this entry

Stage Summary:
- The captures 413-416 (the login + signup pages — the auth pair the secret gate hardens — at phone + desktop) + the VLM battery
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 130/2559 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · db census MATCH (the drift-gate argument carries: docs + tests + server-only code)
- The lessons: L-169c1 the wrap-normalization form (any pin anchoring on wrapped prose normalizes or anchors wrap-proof) · L-169c2 a pin family must audit its OWN members (the DEPLOYMENT pin claimed liveness while entrenching staleness — the live-read re-anchor is the root cure) · L-169c3 the head surgery needs a verified-single guard, not a boundary split

Task: The session-170 post-169 audit round — THE ERROR-BOUNDARY FAMILY + THE BOOT GATE + THE SMOKE LEG + THE ARTIFACT HYGIENE + THE DOCTRINE-STRAGGLER CLOSURE — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned at 567e906 (the s169 ship bba9a7d + its session-log commit); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed on every DB-touching command · db:push + db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s169 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 130/2559 · build (29 routes) · e2e 161/161 · probe:ref STABLE · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap/robots/manifest standing
- The audit (the web-app-foundation §12/§14 lenses + three parallel digest agents + live verification of every claim): TWENTY-ONE findings — the headline F-170a CRITICAL: the standalone artifact shipped .env (the real AUTH_SECRET) + .git/ (171 MB) + db/ (the dev SQLite) + uploads/ + skills/ (194 MB) + docs/ (49 MB) — the upload family's runtime-computed fs paths made @vercel/nft trace the WHOLE repo root + Next's own writeStandaloneDirectory copies .env explicitly; the code legs F-170b/c/d (no error boundaries · no boot gate · no smoke leg — the three §6.2/§13.4/§14 checklist legs); the doc legs (the AGENTS retired-symbol doctrine · the PAD §5.2 color table — the LAST un-flipped carrier · the session-gating counts · the Commands-table gaps · the stale pricing · the LICENSE-file gap)
- THE THREE EXPERIMENTS verified live BEFORE the plan landed: the boot-gate crash against the real standalone boot · the artifact excludes against a real rebuild + the photo-e2e GREEN against the clean ~151 MB artifact · the .env double-cure — all reverted, then re-landed TDD-first
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session170-error-boundaries-boot-gate-smoke-artifact-hygiene-doctrine-stragglers.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD
- WP-1: tests/doctrine-census.test.ts (the 131st suite, +30) — every doc finding pinned live-read; THREE live-caught calibration catches (the pin-form mismatches · the commands-table form · THE CENSUS-OVERCOUNT TRAP: the bare-name requireSession grep counted me/route.ts's NOT-gated comment — the CALL form is the truth: 19 gated / 10 ungated)
- WP-2/3/4: src/lib/chunk-recovery.ts (+12) · src/lib/boot-env.ts + src/instrumentation.ts (+20) · src/app/error.tsx + src/app/global-error.tsx (+17) — the scandihaven ports in the house pure-seam form; the boot gate verified live (the secretless boot refuses to serve)
- WP-5: scripts/smoke-test.sh + the smoke/gate/gate:full wiring + next.config.ts's outputFileTracingExcludes + the build script's rm-f — SMOKE 14/14 PASS live (two live-caught script defects: the contact status vocabulary · the /me data:null face)
- WP-6: the ~21 doc flips (AGENTS/CLAUDE/PAD/SKILL/README/.env.example/LICENSE) + the PAD ADR-015 + the §11 rows + the session-170 inventory row
- WP-7: the count ladder 2559 → 2644 (+85 — the four batteries +79 + the inventory-census's six new §11-row pins, the L-166c3 lesson live again) · SUITES 130 → 134 · E2E 161 held · badge 2720 → 2805 (count-ladder-170.py + skill-head-170.py/skill-head-fix-170.py, assert-first, idempotent — the re-runs verified as 0-flip no-ops) + the collateral re-anchors (gate-script · docs-counts · the space-y census 21/117 → 23/123 · inventory-census next.config 47 → 93 · Appendix B)
- The mutation-proof: the planted badge regression → exactly 1 RED → reverted → GREEN

Stage Summary:
- The captures 417-420 (the boundary pair at phone + desktop against the PRODUCTION build via temporary uncommitted throw patches — reverted after; the VLM battery 4/4, the digest ref verified) + the live-caught capture lessons (the renamed next-server process · the root-layout prerender abort → the NEXT_PHASE guard)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 134/2644 · build (29 routes, the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · SMOKE 14/14 · e2e 161/161 · db census MATCH (the drift-gate argument carries: the round's visual surfaces are failure-path-only)
- The lessons: L-170c1 the census-overcount trap has a comment-match genus (the CALL form is the truth) · L-170c2 the artifact is a deliverable — anything the tracer over-includes SHIPS (the smoke leg polices it forever) · L-170c3 a root-layout throw aborts the static prerender (the NEXT_PHASE guard) · L-170c4 the renamed next-server process survives pkill -f server.js
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-171 post-170 audit round — THE AXE-CORE A11Y TWO-GATE + THE NAMED-CONTROL FAMILY — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned at ddbbd3b (the s170 ship 7d3c551 + its session-log commit); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed on every DB-touching command · db:push + db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s170 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 134/2644 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 161/161 · probe:ref STABLE · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing
- The audit (the live axe probes — OURS across twelve surfaces × two widths + the drawer-open state PLUS the same scan against the REFERENCE's own DOM): FIVE findings — F-171a 19 unnamed SelectTrigger comboboxes on the open surfaces (ROOT CAUSE verified in the axe 4.13 source: role="combobox" names come from author attributes ONLY — subtreeText short-circuits on namedFromContents, the visible span text is INVISIBLE to the name computation) · F-171b 11 bare inert Checkboxes (the dashboard's two Follow-up families) · F-171c 4 hidden-sm:inline icon-only Buttons unnamed at phone width · F-171d no axe-core a11y gate (the §8.3 two-gate never landed — the s170-named next-rotation candidate adopted this round) · F-171e axe-core riding as an undeclared transitive. THE PARITY CONTEXT: the reference ships button-name on EVERY page (2-69 nodes), the IDENTICAL color-contrast palette, and the IDENTICAL funnel svg-img-alt violations (recharts hardcodes role="img" — verified in the 2.15 source, no aria seam)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session171-axe-a11y-two-gate-named-controls.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD (RED birth: a11y-controls 21 failing + 1 born-green → GREEN, mutation-proven)
- WP-2/3: the named-control fixes — aria-label on the 19 open-surface SelectTriggers (the leads-page precedent form "Filter by X"; the contacts rows carry `Role — ${c.name}`) + the two Checkbox families (their sibling-span text) + the 4 icon-only Buttons (their desktop labels) — invisible supersets, ZERO className/DOM changes; the live re-probe: button-name ELIMINATED from every surface
- WP-4: axe-core DECLARED as a devDep ^4.13.0 (bun add -d — the undeclared-transitive standby cured)
- WP-1: tests/a11y-controls.test.ts (the 135th suite, +22) — the named-control census + the devDep pin + the two-gate spec contract
- WP-2: tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts (+25) — the §8.3 two-gate: 9 CRM pages × both widths + 3 anon surfaces × both + the drawer-open; GATE 1 structural-zero; GATE 2 the sanctioned register (the parity palette + the recharts genus, each citation verified on the reference's own DOM incl. the byte-identical .self-start pill); THREE live-caught defects at birth (the loop-registration broke the per-spec test() census → 25 EXPLICIT registrations; the regex-literal \\/ trap → substring matchers; the .self-start pill missed → verified + sanctioned)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2644 → 2668 (+24) · SUITES 134 → 135 · E2E 161 → 186 (+25) · badge 2805 → 2854 (count-ladder-171.py + skill-head-171.py + skill-head-fix-171.py, assert-first, idempotent — the re-runs verified 0-flip no-ops) + the collateral re-anchors (reports-filter-parity · dead-code-hygiene [the 12th devDep] · dialog-geometry [the CLAUDE 2559 straggler the s170 round missed — cured] · login-family · docs-counts · the inventory-census +2 [the two new §11 rows — the L-166c3 lesson live again])
- The docs: the AGENTS Session-171 section · the PAD session-171 inventory row + ADR-016 (the a11y two-gate doctrine) + the two §11 rows · the SKILL v1.168.0 frontmatter + H1 + the s171 head layer + the Appendix A ADR-016 row + the Appendix B a11y row + the wall-clock phrase · the CLAUDE e2e a11y bullet · the README Tested row's a11y mention
- The mutation-proof: the planted badge regression (2854 → 2805) → exactly 1 RED → reverted → GREEN
- The captures 421-424 (the remediated surfaces at phone + desktop — attribute-only by design)

Stage Summary:
- THE ATTRIBUTE-ONLY PROOF: the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS re-run · probe:ref STABLE re-run · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN re-run — the aria-labels changed no pixel; the parity verdict holds (the reference unchanged since the s168 fingerprint)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 135/2668 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 186/186 (the 25 a11y checks GREEN) · db census MATCH
- The lessons: L-171c1 the per-spec test() census demands EXPLICIT registrations (a loop-registered spec undercounts at the source) · L-171c2 the regex-literal \\/ form terminates the literal (substring matchers for escaped-selector targets) · L-171c3 a sanctioned matcher is only as honest as its reference verification (the .self-start pill was sanctioned AFTER the byte-identical form was found on the reference's own DOM)
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Task: The session-172 post-171 audit round — THE DIALOG-SURFACE NAMED-CONTROL CLOSURE + THE FAST-CHECK PROPERTY FAMILY — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned at 48158d5 (the s171 ship 147d3f2 + its session-log commit); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed on every DB-touching command · db:push + db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s171 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 135/2668 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 186/186 · probe:ref STABLE · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing
- The audit (the live OPEN-DIALOG probes — ours across the five CREATE dialogs + the contact EDIT dialog, PLUS the same scan against the REFERENCE's own open dialogs for the parity citation): FIVE findings — F-172a 9 nameless create-dialog SelectTriggers (the closed-by-default genus: a Radix Dialog's content is ABSENT from the DOM while closed — invisible to every open-surface probe AND to the s171 two-gate) · F-172b the entity-edit-dialog family: 5 nameless config-driven SelectTriggers + 17 unlabeled Inputs (the bare <Label>{f.label}</Label> forms no htmlFor/id association) · F-172c no dialog-open coverage in the a11y two-gate · F-172d the fast-check property family never landed (the other s170-named candidate) · F-172e parseCsv's GLOBAL line-ending normalization mutated quoted cells (a quoted CRLF became LF on import — RFC 4180 §2.6 violated; reproduced live). THE PARITY CONTEXT: the reference ships the IDENTICAL nameless-combobox family on every dialog PLUS its own label violations (its event dialog: 4 unlabeled inputs)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session172-dialog-named-controls-property-family.md; validated against the codebase (the csv round-trip defect reproduced live; the s26 mixed-endings test confirmed compatible); executed TDD (RED birth: dialog-controls 6 failing + property 2 failing [the F-172e defect caught by the property AT BIRTH] + 19 born-green, THREE live-caught property-calibration catches → GREEN, mutation-proven)
- WP-3: the named-control + label-wiring fixes — aria-label = the sibling Label's exact text on the 9 create triggers + the edit-dialog htmlFor/id wiring (edit-${f.key}) + aria-label={f.label} on the config arm + THE PARSER FIX (the normalization moved inside the state machine, outside quotes only) — attribute-only, zero className/DOM changes; the live re-probe: ZERO naming violations on every open dialog
- WP-2: the two-gate extension — tests/e2e/a11y.spec.ts +6 EXPLICIT registrations (the five create dialogs + the contact edit dialog); the sanctioned register rides UNCHANGED (the open-dialog landscape verified live)
- WP-1/2: tests/dialog-controls.test.ts (the 136th suite, +14) + tests/property.test.ts (the 137th suite, +13 — the csv round-trip · the guard idempotence · the lead-views/saved-reports round-trips · the formatter/initials robustness · the csvFilename convention) + fast-check ^4.10.2 DECLARED (the 13th devDep — the round's ONE devDep bump)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2668 → 2697 (+29) · SUITES 135 → 137 · E2E 186 → 192 (+6) · badge 2854 → 2889 (count-ladder-172.py + skill-head-172.py, assert-first, idempotent — the re-runs verified 0-flip no-ops) + the collateral re-anchors (dialog-geometry · dead-code-hygiene · inventory-census · docs-counts · login-family · README) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-172 section · the PAD ADR-017 + the inventory row + the two §11 rows · the SKILL v1.169.0 + the s172 head layer · the CLAUDE property section + the a11y bullet · the README Tested row)
- The mutation-proof: the planted badge regression (2889 → 2854) → exactly 1 RED → reverted → GREEN
- The captures 425-428 (the open dialog surfaces at desktop + phone)

Stage Summary:
- THE ATTRIBUTE-ONLY PROOF: the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS re-run · probe:ref STABLE re-run · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN re-run — the labels changed no pixel; the parity verdict holds (the reference unchanged since the s168 fingerprint)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 137/2697 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (the 6 dialog-open scans GREEN, verified standalone 32/32) · db census MATCH
- The lessons: L-172c1 a closed-by-default surface is invisible to every open-state gate — each genus deserves its own open-state walk · L-172c2 a property battery catches defects the example-based family cannot express (the F-172e quoted-CRLF mutation found AT BIRTH) · L-172c3 property generators must respect the seam's OWN domain contracts (the vocabulary intrusion · the undefined-typed field · the ragged-row normalization — three calibrations live-caught at RED birth)
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Task: The session-173 post-172 audit round — THE INJECTABLE CLOCK SEAM + THE RATE-LIMIT WINDOW PROPERTY FAMILY + THE ZOD ROUND-TRIP PROPERTY FAMILY — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned at cfa9506 (the s172 ship c6c2e94 + its session-log commit); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed on every DB-touching command · db:push + db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s172 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 137/2697 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · probe:ref STABLE (the fresh reference probe — the bundle md5 46bc2d9c, the sanctioned-register citations hold; the candidate #3 re-verification covered) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 (the candidate #1 re-walk covered) · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing
- The audit (the seam census, each finding verified live against the source): THREE findings — F-173a rateLimit() read Date.now() internally (the fixed-window arithmetic NOT property-testable — a generator cannot drive the clock; the s164 sweep ALREADY took now = Date.now(), the rateLimit path never joined its own module's injectable form) · F-173b the rate-limit window invariants unpinned as properties (the reset crossing · the retryAfter ceiling · the remaining monotonicity) · F-173c the Zod schema round-trip properties never landed (the ADR-017 doctrine applied to the s166 seam's OWN invariants). The 7 call-site census: all 3-arg calls — the seam refactor purely additive
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session173-injectable-clock-rate-limit-window-zod-roundtrip-properties.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD (RED birth 5 failing + 42 born-green, FOUR live-caught calibration catches → GREEN, mutation-proven + stash-proven)
- WP-3: THE INJECTABLE CLOCK SEAM — rateLimit(key, limit, windowMs, now = Date.now()) — the s164 sweepRateLimits form extended to the rateLimit path; PURELY ADDITIVE (the default is the wall clock, all 7 call sites ride unchanged, zero behavior change on the wire)
- WP-1/2: the deeper property family — tests/property.test.ts +12 (the Zod round-trip half P-h…P-m: the create-defaults quadrant · the enum membership · the emailField trim/lowercase · the PUT three-state · the required-name quadrant · the legacy priority mapping; the rate-limit window half P-n…P-q: the fixed-window reset crossing · the retryAfterSec formula · the remaining monotonicity · the default-clock equivalence) + tests/rate-limit.test.ts +3 (the crossing example · the retryAfter ceiling · the default-form equivalence + the signature source pin); NO new devDep (fast-check rides the s172 declaration)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2697 → 2712 (+15) · SUITES 137 HELD (the family grows in place — the ADR-017 one-suite doctrine) · E2E 192 HELD (the round is seam-only) · badge 2889 → 2904 (count-ladder-173.py + skill-head-173.py, assert-first, idempotent — the re-runs verified 0-flip no-ops) + the collateral re-anchors (the N-67b signature pin · the dialog-geometry CLAUDE lockstep carriers · the inventory-census [property 316 → 723 · rate-limit 126 → 133] · the docs-counts constants + the F-106a1 layer-axis pin) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-173 section · the PAD ADR-018 + the inventory row + the two §11 re-anchors · the SKILL v1.170.0 + the s173 head layer · the CLAUDE property-pyramid extension · the README Tested row)
- The mutation-proof (the planted badge regression 2904 → 2889 → exactly 1 RED → reverted → GREEN) + THE STASH-PROOF (the seam reverted alone → exactly the 5 clock-seam pins RED → restored → GREEN)
- The captures 429-432 (the login funnel surface · the drawer-open standing contract · the dashboard parity anchor · the leads CRUD schema surface)

Stage Summary:
- THE SEAM-ONLY PROOF: the round touched no component, no page, no className — the standing legs (the drawer 7/7 · probe:ref STABLE · the sweeps CLEAN) re-verified at the audit leg; the parity verdict holds (the reference unchanged since the s168 fingerprint)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 137/2712 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH
- The lessons: L-173c1 a time-dependent seam ships with an injectable clock (the sweep precedent now the module-wide rule — the wall-clock battery can never STATE a crossing it cannot wait out) · L-173c2 the stateful property family needs per-run key uniqueness (fc's short-string generator collides within 150 runs against a persistent module map — uniqueness is a property of the RUN, not of the generated input) · L-173c3 the property generator must also guard its own HARNESS (the fc.date NaN edge threw inside toISOString before the seam ever ran — derive in-range inputs through deterministic forms)
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified)

Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-174 post-173 audit round — THE TYPE-GATE HARDENING + THE FULL-STRICT FLIP + THE SINGLE LOCKFILE — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned at 25f1847 (the s173 ship 44dbec5 + its two session-log commits); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push + db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s173 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 137/2712 · build (the ~151 MB hygienic artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · probe:ref STABLE (the bundle md5 46bc2d9c) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer 7/7 PASS at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing
- The rotation trigger: THE REPO'S OWN NEWEST ARTIFACTS (commit 25f1847 — skills/web-application/SKILL.md v1.0.0, the four-sibling family distillation, + skills/web-application/codebase-evaluation-report.md, the comparative audit ranking neo-crm #1 at 8.55 while naming its defect register); the report's §9.2 graft list prescribes exactly the three moves this round lands — the code-wins rule in reverse
- The audit (each finding verified live against the source): F-174a next.config.ts set typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true (the build NOT a type gate — the planted-error class demonstrated live at the gate-proof) · F-174b tsconfig.json carried noImplicitAny: false (the flip probe surfaced exactly THREE implicit-any stragglers repo-wide — scripts/sweep.ts's inline union-find twin of the fully-typed pure seam) · F-174c two lockfiles committed (the §16ba rule superseded by the repo's own new skill's Appendix A lesson 14; the npm-world path verified lockfile-independent)
- The plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-23-session174-type-gate-hardening-build-fails-on-type-errors-single-lockfile.md; validated against the codebase; executed TDD (RED birth 4 failing + 1 born-green → GREEN, gate-proven + mutation-proven + stash-proven)
- WP-2: THE CURE — the ignoreBuildErrors block RETIRED (the typescript key UNSET: Next's default IS the hardened form) · the noImplicitAny escape hatch RETIRED (full TS strictness) with the sweep.ts inline twin typed verbatim like its pure seam · package-lock.json RETIRED (one package manager, one lockfile; the outputFileTracingExcludes entry stays as the defensive tripwire)
- WP-1: tests/type-gate.test.ts — the 138th suite (+5): the build-is-the-type-gate pin + the full-strict pin + the typed union-find pin + the single-lockfile pin + the gate-chain freeze pin (typecheck stays BEFORE build — the manual step the FASTER signal, the build the ENFORCER)
- WP-3: THE GATE-PROOF (the planted type error: build FAILED under the new posture — TS2322 — the SAME plant swallowed under the restored ignoreBuildErrors: the defect demonstrated live) + the mutation-proof (the planted badge regression 2909 → 2904 → exactly 1 RED → reverted → GREEN) + THE STASH-PROOF (the three config moves reverted alone → exactly the 4 type-gate pins RED → restored → 5/5 GREEN)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2712 → 2717 (+5) · SUITES 137 → 138 · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2904 → 2909 (count-ladder-174.py + skill-head-174.py, assert-first, idempotent — the re-runs verified 0-flip no-ops) + the collateral re-anchors (the PAD §11 next.config.ts row 93 → 99 · the dialog-geometry CLAUDE lockstep carriers · the docs-counts constants + the F-106a1 layer-axis pin) + the live-tense flag carriers (the AGENTS gate-order paragraph · the PAD stack-table strict row + the pre-ship checklist · the CLAUDE TypeScript bullet · the SKILL's three config-table rows) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-174 section · the PAD ADR-019 + the session-174 inventory row · the README Tested row + badge + the suite list's type-gate join · session_371.md + the plan's execution record)
- THE LIVE-CAUGHT ENVIRONMENTAL CATCH: the desktop sweep's first run (against the e2e-db standalone server) tripped a profile 1.25% drift — root-caused live as e2e-suite residue in the e2e.db user row (the profile-save test's name suffix + the photo-upload pair's photoUrl), NOT a code defect; re-run the STANDING way (the dev server + the pristine dev DB): both sweeps CLEAN. L-174c1: the sweep's drift gate is only honest against the DB posture it was calibrated on
- The captures 433-436 (the profile surface at desktop — the sweep's drift-gate face · the dashboard parity anchor · the drawer-open standing contract at phone · the accounts surface at phone; VLM-verified)

Stage Summary:
- THE CONFIG-ONLY PROOF: the round touched no component, no page, no className — the standing legs re-verified live (the drawer 7/7 against the NEW hardened artifact · probe:ref STABLE · the sweeps CLEAN) carry the parity verdict unchanged (the reference unchanged since the s168 fingerprint)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 (under FULL strictness) · 138/2717 · build (the hygienic artifact — now the type gate TOO, gate-proven) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH
- The lessons: L-174c1 the sweep's drift gate is only honest against the DB posture it was calibrated on (the e2e db accumulates user-row mutations the zero-data pass never clears — it keeps users by design) · L-174c2 a config retirement is provable the same way a code fix is (the planted-error gate-proof: run the SAME plant both ways — the swallow is a demonstration, not an assertion) · L-174c3 the strictness flip's blast radius was three stragglers in one tool file (the src/ tree was already clean — the escape hatch protected nothing but the stragglers; flipping cost less than the audit feared)
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

Task ID: 175
Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-175 post-174 audit round — THE RESPONSE-SIDE WIRE-CONTRACT FAMILY (the READ half) — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace was RESET (a stale snapshot); the repo re-cloned fresh at f5f96d6 (the s174 ship 483ecad + the owner's three commits: the session-372 transcript, the skills expansion, the re-validated evaluation report + the web-application v1.1.0 + the NEW web-application-engineering sibling); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env + the root db/ · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium 1248 installed (the cache carried 1200 — the first e2e run's setup failure, root-caused and cured before the baseline stood)
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s174 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2717 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN live · the mobile drawer battery GREEN at 390×844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing · census MATCH
- The audit: the READ-side census walked every GET wire surface (the six list routes' include sets + orderBy contracts, the me/login carriers, the types↔wire agreement across all six entities) — ZERO live defects; the deferral register resolved the s371 candidates with rationale (the hosted-CI port DEFERRED per the owner's own newest doctrine + unverifiability; the doc restructure owner-level; the OTP-at-rest item ALREADY SATISFIED — both secrets hashed since s21/s164; recharts 3.x its own rotation)
- The round: THE RESPONSE-SIDE WIRE-CONTRACT FAMILY — P-r the entity wire round-trip (all six route-exact rows survive the wire verbatim: Dates as exact toISOString(), nulls PRESENT, the key set exact, the joined shapes intact) + P-s the envelope pair contract (ok() two-key passthrough + fail() verbatim error arm, through the real helpers) + the crud-zod-seam READ-half source pins (+5); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session175-response-side-wire-contract-family.md, validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- The TDD ledger: 1 RED face (the fc.jsonObject → fc.jsonValue fast-check 4.x API calibration catch) + 8 born-green freeze pins; the proofs: MUTATION-A (the planted include regression → exactly 1 RED) + MUTATION-B (the planted envelope third-key → exactly 1 RED) + THE STASH-PROOF (the test files stashed alone → exactly 138/2717; restored → 2726)
- The count ladder 2717 → 2726 (+9) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2909 → 2918 (count-ladder-175.py: 21 flips, assert-first, idempotent); the collateral re-anchors LIVE-CAUGHT by the suite itself (the PAD §11 property row 723 → 998 · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin · the F-92a3 gate-order form); the docs leg (the AGENTS Session-175 section · the PAD ADR-020 + the inventory row + the §11 re-anchor · the CLAUDE property-pyramid 25 → 29 · the README Tested row + badge · the SKILL v1.172.0 + the s175 head layer · session_373.md + the plan's execution record)
- THE TEST-ONLY PROOF: no product code touched (no component, no page, no className, no route, no config) — the standing legs re-verified at the audit leg carry the parity verdict unchanged

Stage Summary:
- Session-175 SHIPPED: the READ half of the CRUD contracts is now a stated, mutation-proven contract at the seam level (the wire shapes frozen as properties + source pins — a wire-shape regression now fails the unit gate BEFORE any rendered symptom)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2726 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · census MATCH
- SHIPPED: committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

- The workspace warm at 35f04d5 (the s175 ship cccb27b + the owner's session-374 transcript commit — the rotation trigger, its close naming this round verbatim); the baseline gate GREEN at the exact s175 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2726 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (5.4m) · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN · the mobile drawer battery GREEN at 390x844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing · census MATCH — ZERO live defects, the register-retirement round
- The migration census: the official recharts 3.0 guide walked against the NINE chart-type JSX sites (charts.tsx's seven families + the Sparkline area/line arms) — exactly ONE DOM-visible default flip (accessibilityLayer false in 2.x → TRUE in 3.0+); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session176-recharts-3-migration.md (the deferral register resolving the version choice ^3.10.1, the accessibilityLayer-ON rejection, the Cell→shape 4.0-gate deferral), validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- WP-1: the s176 battery in tests/charts-internals.test.ts — 3 RED faces at birth (the version floor · the lockfile resolution · the 9-site accessibilityLayer parity census) + 1 born-green (the e2e grid-sentinel existence freeze)
- WP-2: THE MIGRATION — bun add recharts@^3.10.1 · the parity prop at all nine sites · the type seam closed at the boundary (the tooltipFormatter adapter over the Formatter contravariance + the Pie label double-cast — recharts' own "we spread the data object" note licenses the open-record param) · the L-138c1 guard retained as the harmless form; the tsc census 6 errors → 0
- THE LIVE FACES DECODED: the tick-label texts moved to per-axis z-index layers (the e2e funnel re-anchor) · recharts 3.x elides the zero-value bar rectangles (the e2e reset re-anchor pins the aliveness face — the s10 contract holds) · the x-tick elision at narrow cards is width-borne; THE UPGRADE-PROOF: the e2e L-138c2 grid sentinel passed live on 3.10.1 (the 9-line classic grid)
- THE CENSUS EXTENSION: the signature-matched recharts3-restructure genus (+3 its in the census-tool suite, negatives pinned: a DIV pair + a real-drift same-class tick stay RED) + THE COLLECTOR CHART-INTERIOR EXCLUSION (the walk42 glyph doctrine extended to the chart svg — the tablet phantom-+581 decode: the version-borne interiors sustained FALSE resync offsets over apps a direct probe proved byte-equal at every card position; the recharts svg BOX stays censused, the interior never enters the alignment)
- The proofs: MUTATION-A (the planted version regression → exactly 1 RED) · MUTATION-B (the planted parity-prop removal → exactly 1 RED) · THE STASH-PROOF (the five source files stashed alone → exactly 6 RED; restored → 2733 GREEN)
- WP-4: the count ladder 2726 → 2733 (+7) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2918 → 2925 (count-ladder-176.py: 23 flips, assert-first, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors (the PAD stack-table row 2.15.4 → 3.10.1 · the facts-census installed row · the s140 funnel + reports-filter spark opening-tag forms · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-176 section · the PAD ADR-021 + the inventory row · the CLAUDE recharts bullet · the README Tested row + the badge · the SKILL v1.173.0 + the s176 head layer [skill-head-176.py, idempotent] · session_375.md + the plan's execution record)
- WP-5: the captures 441-444 (the dashboard + the aging-grid sentinel face, both VLM-verified; the drawer-open standing contract; the leads surface at phone)

Stage Summary:
- THE DRIFT-GATE LEDGER: the six gates re-run in full at the migrated tree — the four sweeps CLEAN (dashboard 0.07%, reports 0.21% — within the standing floors) · the fullpage CLEAN (docH byte-equal 4990/7259) · the interior census CLEAN at all four axes — THE MIGRATION IS RENDER-IDENTICAL, the s373 close's predicted baseline re-derivation NOT needed, the standing baselines hold
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 (full strictness under the 3.x types) · 138/2733 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the drawer battery GREEN
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (remote verified; no new branches)

Task: The session-177 post-176 audit round — THE DRAWER INTERIOR RE-WALK (walk50) — TDD remediation, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned fresh at 59c8f13 (the s176 ship f484701 + the owner's session-376 transcript commit — the rotation trigger, its close naming the walk first); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH · playwright chromium
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s176 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2733 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (5.7m) · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c — the fresh-bundle candidate killed) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN · the mobile drawer battery GREEN at 390x844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing · census MATCH — ZERO live defects; the Base44 reference re-verified live (login → landing → dashboard → the TRUE-390 drawer with its 8 links)
- The round: THE DRAWER INTERIOR RE-WALK — the six-consecutive-closes candidate no round ever ran (the coverage gap real: the interior census runs zero drawer-open pages · the battery pins behavior · the a11y gate violations · the captures visuals); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session177-drawer-interior-rewalk.md, validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- WP-1: scripts/walk50-drawer-interior.ts — the two-app element-ledger of the drawer-OPEN DOM (both apps at 390x844, the DFS spine of tag/class/aria/text/geometry, the reference on the sweep-state pair): OURS 61 rows vs REF 53, every delta root-caused
- WP-2: ONE LIVE DEFECT FOUND — the drawer header's space-y-2 riding the v4 margin-BOTTOM semantics (the h2's :where() mb-2 IN flow, header 88px, where the reference's v3-era mt-on-the-sr-only-p never was — header 80px): an 8px spine shift cascading to every nav link + the footer group, present since s147, never caught because no leg ever walked the open drawer's interior; + the adjudicated genera (the bg-sidebar/bg-[#2563eb] computed-equal · the Close button's dead shadcn variants, live-probed transparent both apps · lucide aria-hidden · the useId format · the kept supersets re-verified invisible — the span.truncate wrapper the 61-53=8 root cause)
- WP-3: THE CURE — the explicit mb-0 on MOBILE_NAV_SHEET.title (the M-92c1 phantom-mb precedent: (0,1,0) beats :where()'s (0,0,0); the header's space-y-2 class string stays byte-parity, the computed rhythm goes byte-equal 24+32+24=80); the TDD ledger: 1 RED face at birth (the title mb-0 pin) + 1 born-green (the walk50 decode freeze, the s173 P-p/P-q precedent); the s147 title pin re-anchored in place
- WP-4: THE POST-CURE SPINE — the walk re-run: header 80/80 · h2 32/32 · all 9 links byte-equal · footer 428/428 · the two-app drawer-open captures 0.02% apart (the font floor); the proofs: MUTATION-PROOF (the planted mb-0 regression → exactly 1 RED → restored → GREEN) · STASH-PROOF (the round's five lockstep files stashed → exactly 138/2733 → restored → 2735) · the drawer battery re-run GREEN (zero behavioral face)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2733 → 2735 (+2) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2925 → 2927 (count-ladder-177.py: 23 flips, assert-first, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors LIVE-CAUGHT by the suite (the PAD §11 page-layout row 1687 → 1695 · the SKILL §5.6 census 1687/210 → 1695/212 · the docs-counts four-site lockstep) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-177 section · the PAD ADR-022 + the inventory row + the §11 re-anchor · the CLAUDE mobile-navigation bullet's walk50 extension · the README Tested row + badge · the SKILL v1.174.0 + H1 + the s177 head layer [the s176 layer comment-demoted at its ship counts 2733/192; skill-head-177.py, idempotent] · session_377.md + the plan's execution record + this worklog entry)
- WP-6: the captures 443-REANCHOR + 445-448 (the post-cure drawer-open standing contract, VLM-verified · the reference's own drawer-open parity face · the header wordmark detail · the leads-active drawer)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE (ADR-022): a surface's parity is only proven by walking its OPEN/ACTIVE DOM — the pixels never showed the 8px shift (the page sweeps never open the drawer); the v4 space-y margin-BOTTOM semantics is a standing per-surface hazard, cured per-surface with the explicit zero-margin override, never by rewriting the reference's literals
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2735 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the sweeps CLEAN · the drawer battery GREEN · the walk50 spine byte-equal
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

Task ID: 178
Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-178 post-177 audit round — THE TOPBAR SEARCH FOCUS + SETTINGS SEGMENTED-ACTIVE WALK (walk51) — TDD decode-freeze battery, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned fresh at 29b7954 (the s177 ship); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH · the environmental playwright chromium-1248 install
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s177 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2735 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (5.4m) · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c — the fresh-bundle candidate killed) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN · the mobile drawer battery GREEN at 390x844 · the Tailwind v4 state clean · sitemap 11 routes + robots + manifest standing · census MATCH — ZERO live defects
- The round: the two oldest unwalked OPEN/ACTIVE interiors the s177 close names (the topbar search focus state + the settings segmented tabs' active state, adjudicated per ADR-022); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session178-topbar-search-focus-segmented-active-walk.md, validated against the codebase (the INPUT_BASE/SEARCH_INPUT/TABS_SEGMENTED contracts, the existing pin survey), executed TDD
- WP-1: scripts/walk51-search-focus-segmented-active.ts — one tool two phases: Phase A the search FOCUS state (both apps at 1440x900, REAL keyboard Tab focus — 9 tabs on both, the same placeholder locator — the resting + focused computed census incl. the outline triplet) + Phase B the segmented ACTIVE state (both apps at 1440x900 AND 390x844, the default + the click-activated second tab, the track + three triggers + the active pill's computed bg/shadow/ink/weight)
- WP-2: ZERO LIVE DEFECTS — every delta a documented genus or kept superset, every VISIBLE face byte-equal (the resting shadow-sm · the focused 1px near-black ring rgb(10,10,10) · the active white pill + the bare-shadow pair + ink + weight 500 at BOTH viewports · the tablist's computed bg/color — the house token idiom); THE NEW DOCUMENTED GENUS: v4's outline-none = outline-style:none vs the reference's v3-era 2px solid transparent (zero pixels on both — the shadow/blur/space-y rename family's FOURTH member, documented in the AGENTS register + the CLAUDE bullet); the box-shadow slot-count genus (v4's 5 slots vs the v3-era's 3, extras transparent/clipped); OUR kept supersets re-verified live (the search aria-label — the reference's field carries NONE · the roving tabindex [0,-1,-1] vs the reference's [-1,-1,-1] · the s125 bg-white literal + the s129 retired ring-offset standing against the reference's own stock class)
- WP-3: the TDD battery — all 5 pins born-green over the zero-defect decode (the s173 P-p/P-q contract-freeze precedent), all in the existing page-layout suite (the ADR-017 one-suite doctrine)
- WP-4: the proofs — MUTATION-PROOFS: three planted regressions (the focus-ring ring-2 · the ring-offset-background replant · the tabindex flip) → exactly 1 RED each → restored → GREEN; STASH-PROOF: the round's test file stashed alone → exactly 138/2735 (the s177 ship state) → restored → 138/2740; the standing-gate adjudication: ZERO unexplained deltas → no census extension built (the walk tool the standing script)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2735 → 2740 (+5) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD (test-only — no product code touched) · badge 2927 → 2932 (count-ladder-178.py: 23 flips, assert-first, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors LIVE-CAUGHT by the suite (the SKILL §5.6 census 212 → 217 checks, the module untouched at 1695 · the docs-counts lockstep · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-178 section + the v4 register's outline-none member · the PAD session-178 inventory row · the CLAUDE v4-bullet hazard list · the README Tested row's walk51 clause + the badge · the SKILL v1.175.0 + H1 + the s178 head layer [the s177 layer comment-demoted at its ship counts 2735/192; skill-head-178.py, idempotent] · session_379.md + the plan's execution record + this worklog entry)
- WP-6: the captures 449-452 (the two apps' FOCUSED search inputs at desktop — the parity anchor, VLM-verified: the thin dark ring + the placeholder + the icon on BOTH · the segmented click-activated ACTIVE at desktop, VLM-verified: the Defaults raised white pill · the segmented ACTIVE at phone, VLM-verified: the w-full track)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE APPLIED: ADR-022's first maiden walk since the ADR itself — the two oldest unwalked OPEN/ACTIVE interiors walked two-app, ZERO live defects found, the v4 outline-none rename decoded as the hazard family's fourth member, the surfaces' contracts frozen (5 born-green pins, mutation-proven)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2740 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the sweeps CLEAN · the drawer battery GREEN · the walk51 visible faces byte-equal
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

Task ID: 179
Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-179 post-178 audit round — THE REPORTS PILL-TAB FOCUS-STATE INTERIOR RE-WALK (walk52) — after the local s178 twin yielded to the external ship — TDD, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The rotation raced: this workspace completed its own session-178 (the walk51 twin — same subject, same 2735->2740 ladder, same decode: the v4 outline genus, the roving tabindex, the byte-equality, 0.00%-pixel captures) and committed 23d81b5, but the push was REJECTED — the owner had already merged the EXTERNAL session-178 walk51 ship into main (fdca37a + the merge eebf8dc). The twin YIELDED per the house single-layer doctrine (merging would double every s178 documentation layer): git reset --hard origin/main, the local commit discarded, the round re-based as session-179
- The baseline at the shipped s178 state (eebf8dc): lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2740 · census MATCH — zero live defects (the external round's ledger trusted only after the local re-run); probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c — the fresh-bundle candidate killed; the registry's latest 3.10.1 — the 4.0 gate killed); the rotation: the s379 close's first-named candidate — the pill-tab focus states on the reports family, the s129 close's own never-censused list
- WP-1: scripts/walk52-pill-focus-active.ts — the two-app computed ledger of the PILL family's focus + active faces at BOTH axes (1440x900 + 390x844): the REAL keyboard Tab drive + the effective-layer box-shadow alignment + the REAL tab switch
- WP-2: the decode — ZERO LIVE DEFECTS: the FOCUSED pill trigger's ring byte-equal on BOTH axes (rgb(255,255,255) 0 0 0 2px + rgb(10,10,10) 0 0 0 4px + the active bare-shadow pair — the ring-2+offset-2 form computing IDENTICALLY on both apps) · the pill interior geometry byte-equal at zero-data (x=293/515/737/959/1181 · w=222 · h=28) · the switched active face byte-equal + the post-interaction roving tabindex=0 on BOTH apps; the genera: F-129c1 · the token-selection genus · the class-order genus · the outline VERSION FORM (s178-documented, re-met) · the DATA-STATE genus (the seeded-vs-zero 32px page offset above the reports tab bar — the pill interior byte-equal at zero-data, VERIFIED LIVE via scripts/zero-data.ts, the seed restored after)
- WP-3: the TDD battery — 4 born-green pins (the s173 P-p/P-q contract-freeze family): the walk52 decode freeze · the TABS_PILL.trigger FULL-string freeze · the TABS_PILL.track FULL-string freeze · the data-state genus pin
- WP-4: the proofs — MUTATION-PROOF (the planted ring-2->ring-1 regression -> exactly 1 RED -> restored -> GREEN) · STASH-PROOF (the round's test file stashed -> exactly 138/2740 -> restored -> 138/2744)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2740 -> 2744 (+4) · badge 2932 -> 2936 (count-ladder-179.py: 23 flips, assert-first, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors (the SKILL §5.6 census checks 217 -> 221, the module line count 1695 HELD · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin — the s179 layer live, the s178 layer demoted at 2740/192) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-179 section · the PAD session-179 inventory row · the CLAUDE tabs-aria bullet's walk52 tail · the README Tested row's walk52 clause + the badge · the SKILL v1.176.0 + the s179 head layer [skill-head-179.py, idempotent] · session_380.md + the plan doc + its execution record + this worklog entry)
- WP-6: the captures 453-454 (the reports pill focus state ours+ref — the focused ring's own face under REAL keyboard focus)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE'S THIRD DEPOSIT: the PILL family's focus face walk-proven byte-equal on both axes — walk50 (the drawer OPEN), walk51 (the search/segmented ACTIVE), walk52 (the pill FOCUS): the three-interior standing battery for the fresh-bundle re-derivation
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2744 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the walk52 focus ring byte-equal on both axes
- SHIPPED: the remediated codebase committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

Task ID: 180
Agent: main (Z.ai)
Task: The session-180 post-179 audit round — THE DROPDOWN/SELECT OPEN-STATE INTERIOR WALK (walk53) + the 180-a live find (the tripled PAD row) — TDD, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned fresh at 3b21544 (the s179 ship d799411 + the owner's two transcript commits 6ff2ba7/3b21544 — the session_381 transcript + the prompt-to-review-3 doc, this round's rotation trigger); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH (15/24/10/23/12 + 4 users) · the environmental playwright chromium-1248 install
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s179 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2744 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (one first-run flake in the S72-P2/M-72c1 settings-debounce test — the documented F-119a1 epoch-gate lineage — passed in isolation AND on the full re-run; a machine-load observation, never a live defect) · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c) · the drawer battery GREEN at 390x844 · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN (the settings 2.65%/3.63% picklist-data genus live-edited intraday on the reference — the walk40 ref-vs-ref doctrine; login 0.28%/0.78% the logo genus) · census MATCH · sitemap + robots + manifest 200
- The operator's standing asks all verified: the .env DATABASE_URL file:../db/custom.db with db/ at the repo root (census MATCH) · the vitest + playwright configs standing (138/2744 + 192/192 this session — no churn; a change without a failing gate would be speculative) · the sitemap/SEO surface (11 routes + the robots Sitemap line + the manifest, smoke check 12) · the mobile-nav comparison (probe:ref TRUE-390 STANDING — the reference's own menu button live; OURS the Radix Sheet superset, the drawer battery GREEN) · the Tailwind v4 state clean · the .env.example verified against the six-knob contract + included in the commit
- The rotation adjudication: probe:ref STABLE kills the fresh-bundle candidate; recharts latest 3.10.1 (verified live against registry.npmjs.org) kills the 4.0 gate; the round = the s380 close's first-named candidate — the remaining unwalked OPEN interiors (the dropdown/select OPEN states beyond the s133/s136 lenses + the account-menu OPEN re-walk under ADR-022); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session180-dropdown-open-interior-rewalk.md, validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- WP-1: scripts/discover-180.ts (the discovery probe — the trigger locator button[aria-haspopup=menu]: the reference's trigger carries NO aria-label, ours the kept superset; the Defaults combobox pair at byte-equal geometry) + scripts/walk53-dropdown-open-interior.ts (the walk50 ledger form over the OPEN states at BOTH axes: Phase A the account-menu, Phase B the settings Defaults "Default Calendar View" select; the REAL keyboard ArrowDown drive + the mount-focus census + the computed faces RESTING and HIGHLIGHTED); ONE locator calibration mid-maiden — THE WALK'S OWN DISCOVERY: Playwright's getByRole("combobox") engine STOPS matching the trigger once aria-expanded flips true at open (count 0 while the raw [role=combobox] attribute stays live); the attribute selector the only form matching both states, documented + pinned
- WP-2: ZERO LIVE DEFECTS — the menu spine byte-equal on both axes (3 rows · zero box deltas · mount-focus DIV/menu both · ArrowDown -> Profile both) · the listbox spine byte-equal (Month/Week · checked/unchecked identical · mount-focus DIV/option both · ArrowDown -> Week both) · every VISIBLE OPEN face byte-equal; the genera: the outline VERSION FORM (re-met + the NEW alpha-color carrier sub-form: 3px none rgb(10,10,10) vs 3px none rgba(10,10,10,0.5) — style none paints ZERO pixels on both) · the box-shadow slot-count genus · the token-selection genus (computed-equal resting AND REAL-keyboard-highlighted — the M-81c2 #f5f5f5 wash + the #171717 ink shift) · the useId format genus · lucide's aria-hidden
- WP-3: the TDD battery — 5 born-green pins (the walk53 decode freeze · the MENU_CONTENT FULL-string freeze · the MENU_ITEM FULL-string freeze [the s179 FULL-string precedent over the s13/s63/s113/s128 fragment pins] · the select.tsx content/item full-string freezes [the M-81c1/M-81c2 carriers]), the pin survey first
- THE 180-a LIVE FIND + CURE: the external s179 ship had TRIPLED its PAD §7.1 inventory row (three near-identical walk52 rows — a single-layer-doctrine violation that shipped through the gate; no pin held the table's row multiplicity); the TDD cure — the new docs-counts inventory-row uniqueness pin RED over the live triplication FIRST -> the two duplicate rows removed (the first/most-complete kept) -> GREEN; a future round that doubles its row now fails bun run test
- WP-4: the proofs — MUTATION-PROOF (the planted MENU_ITEM disabled-arm order swap -> exactly 1 RED — the full-string pin's unique teeth over the fragment pins; the shadow-md + class-order mutations tripped the older fragment pins too, both documented) · STASH-PROOF (the round's test file stashed -> exactly 138/2744 -> restored -> 138/2749 pre-find)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2744 -> 2750 (+6: 5 the walk53 pins + 1 the RED-first uniqueness pin; the two-pass full-ladder form — count-ladder-180.py: 23 flips, idempotent) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2936 -> 2942 + the collateral re-anchors (the SKILL §5.6 census checks 221 -> 226, the module 1695 HELD · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin — the s180 layer live, the s179 demoted at 2744/192) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-180 section · the PAD s180 inventory row + the tripled-row dedupe · the CLAUDE page-layout bullet's walk53 tail · the README Tested row's walk53 clause + the badge · the SKILL v1.177.0 + the s180 head layer [skill-head-180.py, idempotent] · session_382.md + the plan's execution record + this worklog entry)
- WP-6: the captures 455-458 (the account-menu OPEN ours+ref + the select OPEN ours+ref — BOTH pairs 0.00% pixel-diff byte-equal, VLM-verified: the highlighted Profile wash + the Month checkmark on both, zero visible differences) + the capture decode lesson (the dashboard-variant's shadow-below band blended with the KPI chart content beneath — the standing chart genus; re-shot over the settings Defaults card, the menu's own faces byte-equal either way)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE'S FOURTH DEPOSIT: the dropdown/select OPEN interiors walk-proven byte-equal on both axes — walk50 (the drawer OPEN), walk51 (the search/segmented ACTIVE), walk52 (the pill FOCUS), walk53 (the MENU + LISTBOX OPEN): the four-interior standing battery for the fresh-bundle re-derivation
- THE 180-a LIVE FIND: the external s179 ship's tripled PAD inventory row — caught, cured, and pinned (RED-first); the single-layer doctrine now under the unit gate
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2750 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the walk53 OPEN spines byte-equal · the captures both pairs 0.00%

Task: The session-181 post-180 audit round — THE DIALOG-SURFACE FOCUS-STATE INTERIOR WALK (walk54) — TDD, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned fresh at 144f2dd (the s180 ship e4e39ef + the owner's transcript commits b8e740d/c4a5c4e — the session_383 transcript, this round's rotation trigger — + the merge); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH (15/24/10/23/12 + 4 users) · the environmental playwright chromium-1248 install
- The baseline gate GREEN at the exact s180 ship state: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2750 · build · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 (clean first run) · probe:ref STABLE (46bc2d9c) · the drawer battery GREEN at 390x844 (all six stages) · the desktop + phone sweeps CLEAN · census MATCH · sitemap + robots + manifest 200 · the Tailwind v4 state clean
- The operator's standing asks all verified: the .env DATABASE_URL file:../db/custom.db with db/ at the repo root (census MATCH) · the vitest + playwright configs standing (138/2750 + 192/192 this session — no churn) · the sitemap/SEO surface (11 routes + the robots Sitemap line + the manifest, smoke check 12) · the mobile-nav comparison (probe:ref TRUE-390 STANDING — the reference's own menu button live; OURS the Radix Sheet superset, the drawer battery GREEN) · the Tailwind v4 state clean · the .env.example verified against the six-knob contract + included in the commit
- The rotation adjudication: probe:ref STABLE kills the fresh-bundle candidate; recharts latest 3.10.1 (verified live against registry.npmjs.org) kills the 4.0 gate; the round = the s380 close's remaining named candidate — the dialog-surface focus faces (the s379 close's own third arm; walk53 consumed the dropdown/select arm, walk54 takes the dialog family's focus interior); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session181-dialog-focus-interior-walk.md, validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- WP-1: scripts/discover-181.ts (the discovery probe — the New Lead trigger count 1 at byte-equal geometry on both apps; the OPEN dialog's 12-row focusable inventory at IDENTICAL boxes; the mount-focus on the first input with :focus-visible TRUE on both) + scripts/walk54-dialog-focus-interior.ts (the walk50 ledger form over the New Lead dialog's OPEN + FOCUS states at BOTH axes: Phase A the 51-row OPEN spine + the computed faces RESTING, Phase B the REAL keyboard Tab drive — 10 stops with each FOCUSED face censused + the wrap past the last focusable); ONE locator calibration mid-maiden — the overlay probe re-keyed on [data-state="open"]:not([role="dialog"]) (the portal mounts overlay + content as BODY-level siblings; [data-radix-dialog-overlay] matches nothing on either app)
- WP-2: ZERO LIVE DEFECTS — the 51-row spine byte-equal on both axes (identical tag census, ZERO box deltas) · the Tab chain position-identical on every stop + the WRAP to the first input on both apps · every VISIBLE focus face byte-equal (the input/select-trigger/Cancel ring rgb(10,10,10) 1px + the submit ring + the close X's DOUBLE ring rgb(255,255,255) 2px + rgb(10,10,10) 4px); the genera: the outline VERSION FORM + alpha-color sub-form · the box-shadow slot-count (3-vs-1/4-vs-2/2-vs-0 — every VISIBLE layer byte-equal) · the v4 color-serialization (the overlay's oklab(0 0 0 / 0.8) vs rgba(0,0,0,0.8) — the SAME visual color, the s28 canvas-readback precedent) · the token-selection · the class-order · the space-y margin-BOTTOM family · the s133 placeholderState retirement · the F-129c1 ring-offset retirement · the id-name superset · the aria-label supersets · the useId format · lucide's aria-hidden; THE WALK'S OWN DISCOVERY — the NEW DANGLING aria-describedby genus: the reference's OPEN dialog declares aria-describedby pointing at a NON-EXISTENT node (its own platform's dead pointer, live-probed "NO SUCH ELEMENT"); OURS the clean no-attribute form (the s15-P4 doctrine; the reference's own defect NOT mirrored per the s23 precedent)
- WP-3: the TDD battery — 4 born-green pins (the walk54 decode freeze [the tool's own contract, incl. the D-112a4 root rule + the overlay-selector finding] · the DIALOG_CONTENT.base FULL-string freeze · the DIALOG_CLOSE FULL-string freeze [the focused DOUBLE-ring carrier] · the DIALOG_OVERLAY FULL-string freeze [the oklab/rgba carrier]), the pin survey first (INPUT_BASE/BUTTON_BASE focus rings already full-pinned s9/s10 · DIALOG_FOOTER/HEADER s15)
- WP-4: the proofs — MUTATION-PROOF (the planted focus:ring-offset-2 -> focus:ring-offset-4 regression -> exactly 1 RED — the full-string pin's unique teeth, the offset arm no fragment pin holds -> restored -> GREEN) · STASH-PROOF (the round's test file stashed -> exactly 138/2750 -> restored -> 138/2754)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2750 -> 2754 (+4) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2942 -> 2946 (count-ladder-181.py: 23 flips, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors (the SKILL §5.6 census checks 226 -> 230, the module 1695 HELD · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin — the s181 layer live, the s180 demoted at 2750/192) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-181 section · the PAD s181 inventory row · the CLAUDE page-layout bullet's walk54 tail · the README Tested row's walk54 clause + the badge · the SKILL v1.178.0 + the s181 head layer [skill-head-181.py, idempotent] · session_384.md + the plan's execution record + this worklog entry)
- WP-6: the captures 459-462 (the mount-focused input ours+ref + the REAL-keyboard-focused close X ours+ref — BOTH pairs 0.00% pixel-diff, BYTE-IDENTICAL with the same md5, VLM-verified content: the thin near-black ring on the input, the rounded-square double-ring enclosure on the X)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE'S FIFTH DEPOSIT: the dialog family's focus interior walk-proven byte-equal on both axes — walk50 (the drawer OPEN), walk51 (the search/segmented ACTIVE), walk52 (the pill FOCUS), walk53 (the MENU + LISTBOX OPEN), walk54 (the DIALOG focus): the five-interior standing battery for the fresh-bundle re-derivation
- THE NEW GENUS: the DANGLING aria-describedby — the reference's own platform's dead ARIA pointer decoded + documented (ours the clean form); the v4 color-serialization genus re-met on the dialog overlay (oklab vs rgba, the same visual color)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2754 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the walk54 focus faces byte-equal · the captures both pairs 0.00% (byte-identical)
- SHIPPED: committed to main and pushed via docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py (the remote verified; no new branches)

Task: The session-182 post-181 audit round — THE REPORTS-FILTER SELECTS OPEN-STATE INTERIOR WALK (walk55) — TDD, docs lockstep, push to main via the SSH wrapper.

Work Log:
- The workspace re-cloned fresh at e59fc03 (the s181 ship ea86922 + the owner's transcript commit e59fc03 — the session_385 transcript, this round's rotation trigger); the fresh-sandbox intake: bun install · .env with a fresh 64-char AUTH_SECRET + file:../db/custom.db · the ambient DATABASE_URL shadow scrubbed with env -u on every DB-touching command · db:push/db:seed · census MATCH (15/24/10/23/12 + 4 users) · the environmental playwright chromium-1248 install

- The rotation adjudication: probe:ref STABLE kills the fresh-bundle candidate; recharts latest 3.10.1 (verified live against registry.npmjs.org) kills the 4.0 gate; the round = the s384 close's first-named candidate — the reports filter selects' OPEN states beyond the walk53 settings arm (the s385 close's own first arm); the plan landed at docs/plans/2026-10-24-session182-reports-selects-open-interior-walk.md, validated against the codebase, executed TDD
- WP-1: scripts/discover-182.ts (the discovery probe — the four comboboxes at byte-equal geometry on both apps at 329/541/729/917,202 176x36; OURS carrying the four aria-label supersets the reference's triggers lack — the walk53 account-menu genus; the mount-focus DIV/option on every open; the period/stage/status vocabularies byte-equal 6/7/4; the owner select the data-borne arm) + scripts/walk55-reports-selects-open.ts (the walk53 ledger form over the four selects' OPEN states at BOTH axes: the trigger RESTING + OPEN faces, the listbox DFS ledger, the option faces RESTING + the checked option's HIGHLIGHTED face, then the REAL keyboard ArrowDown drive); the walk re-run STABLE (byte-identical delta report)
- WP-2: ZERO LIVE DEFECTS — the period spine 24 rows byte-equal on both axes (checked This Quarter both, ArrowDown -> YTD both) · the stage spine 27 rows byte-equal (ArrowDown -> Prospecting both) · the status spine 18 rows byte-equal (ArrowDown -> Open both) · the owner arm the DATA-STATE genus (OURS 18 rows / 4 options: All Owners + the 3 DISTINCT seeded opp owners; the reference 9 rows / 1 option at its live zero-data state; the height 138-vs-42 + the ArrowDown landing the data-borne consequences); the genera: the outline VERSION FORM + BOTH sub-forms (the alpha-color carrier on the triggers · the transparent-solid carrier on the options) · the box-shadow slot-count (5-vs-3 trigger · 6-vs-4 content — every VISIBLE layer byte-equal) · the token-selection (the M-81c2 pair, computed-equal) · the useId format · lucide's aria-hidden · the aria-label superset; the walk's own decode knowledge: the mount-focus lands ON the checked option · the checked option carries data-highlighted at open · the trigger's OPEN face byte-equal to its own RESTING face on both apps
- WP-3: the TDD battery — 3 born-green pins (the walk55 decode freeze · the DISTINCT-opportunity-owners derivation freeze [the s31 contract, the DATA-STATE arm's source carrier — the genuine gap] · the SELECT_ITEM indicator span + Check pair full-string freeze [the genuine s180-battery gap]), the pin survey first
- WP-4: the proofs — MUTATION-PROOF (the planted h-3.5 w-3.5 -> h-4 w-4 indicator regression -> exactly 1 RED — the new pin's unique teeth, no s180 fragment pin holds the indicator construction -> restored -> GREEN) · STASH-PROOF (the round's test block stashed -> exactly 138/2754 -> restored -> 138/2757)
- WP-5: the count ladder 2754 -> 2757 (+3) · SUITES 138 HELD · E2E 192 HELD · badge 2946 -> 2949 (count-ladder-182.py: 30 flips, assert-first, idempotent — the re-run a verified 0-flip no-op) + the collateral re-anchors (the SKILL §5.6 census checks 230 -> 233 with the F-108a2 negatives-ladder extended · the module 1695 HELD · the F-106a1 layer-axis pin — the s182 layer live, the s181 demoted at 2754/192) + the docs (the AGENTS Session-182 section · the PAD s182 inventory row · the CLAUDE page-layout bullet's walk55 tail · the README Tested row's walk55 clause + the badge · the SKILL v1.179.0 + the s182 head layer [skill-head-182.py, idempotent] · session_386.md + the plan's execution record + this worklog entry [Task ID 182])
- WP-6: the captures 463-466 (the period select OPEN ours+ref — the pair 0.00% pixel-diff, BYTE-IDENTICAL with the same md5, VLM-verified: the six options with This Quarter checked + the gray wash + the checkmark on both; the owner select OPEN ours+ref — the DATA-STATE face, the height delta 154-vs-58 the genus's own visible form, VLM-verified: the 4-option seeded list on ours vs the All Owners-only zero-data list on the reference's)

Stage Summary:
- THE DOCTRINE'S SIXTH DEPOSIT: the reports-filter selects' OPEN interiors walk-proven byte-equal on both axes — walk50 (the drawer OPEN), walk51 (the search/segmented ACTIVE), walk52 (the pill FOCUS), walk53 (the MENU + LISTBOX OPEN), walk54 (the DIALOG focus), walk55 (the reports selects OPEN): the six-interior standing battery for the fresh-bundle re-derivation
- THE DECODE KNOWLEDGE: the mount-focus lands ON the checked option (Radix's at-open highlight); the trigger's OPEN face byte-equal to its own RESTING face; the DATA-STATE genus's behavioral consequence on the keyboard drive (the highlight stays on the sole option at zero-data)
- THE VERIFICATION: lint 0/0 · tsc 0 · 138/2757 · build (the type-gate artifact) · smoke 14/14 · e2e 192/192 · db census MATCH · probe:ref STABLE · the walk55 select interiors byte-equal · the captures the period pair 0.00% (byte-identical), the owner pair the DATA-STATE face
